# 1. The Agreement Problem

## What Does "Agreement with Reality" Mean?

• **Traditional definition**: Truth means ideas "agree" with reality, falsity means "disagreement"

* Both pragmatists and intellectualists accept this starting point

## "Agreement with Reality: the copying model fails"

* Works for simple sensible things: "Shut your eyes and think of yonder clock on the wall, and you get just such a true picture or copy of its dial"
* Breaks down for abstract concepts: "Your idea of its 'works'... is much less of a copy, yet it passes muster"

These are my speaker notes. I can write detailed explanations, reminders, or talking points here. The audience won't see this - only I will when I press 'S' during the presentation.

## "Agreement with Reality": abstract realities resist copying

* "Past time," "power," "spontaneity" - "how can our mind copy such realities?"
* Even "time-keeping function" or "spring's elasticity" - "hard to see exactly what your ideas can copy"
* **The core question**: "Where our ideas cannot copy definitely their object, what does agreement with that object mean?"

# 2: Truth as Dynamic Process: truth happens to an idea

* **Against static conception**:
* Intellectualists: "truth means essentially an inert static relation"
* "When you've got your true idea of anything, there's an end of the matter"

::: {.notes}

:::

## Truth as Dynamic Process: James's alternative

* **Truth is dynamic and active**
* "The truth of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent in it"
* "Truth happens to an idea. It becomes true, is made true by events"

* **Process terminology**:
* "Its verity is in fact an event, a process... of its verifying itself"
* "Its validity is the process of its valid-ation"

::: {.notes}

:::

## Truth as Dynamic Process: James's alternative: Pragmatic question
* "What concrete difference will its being true make in anyone's actual life?"

# 3: Direct vs Indirect Verification
* **Direct verification**:
* Lost in woods example: "If I am lost in the woods and starved, and find what looks like a cow-path"
* Success criterion: "if I do so and follow it, I save myself"

::: {.notes}

:::

# Direct vs Indirect Verification: indirect verification
* **Indirect verification dominates**:
* Clock example: "no one of us has seen the hidden works that make it one"
* "We let our notion pass for true without attempting to verify"

::: {.notes}

:::

## Direct vs Indirect Verification: the credit system of truth

* "Truth lives, in fact, for the most part on a credit system"
* "Our thoughts and beliefs 'pass' so long as nothing challenges them, just as bank notes pass"
* "You accept my verification of one thing, I yours of another"
* **Foundation needed**: "All this points to direct face-to-face verifications somewhere, without which the fabric of truth collapses"

# 4: Truth's Practical Value: What Is Truth's Cash Value?

* **Instrumental nature**: "The possession of truth... is only a preliminary means towards other vital satisfactions"
* **Practical importance**:
  * "We live in a world of realities that can be infinitely useful or infinitely harmful"{.smaller}
  * "Ideas that tell us which of them to expect count as the true ideas"{.smaller}

::: {.notes}

:::

# Truth's Practical Value: value equation
* "You can say of it then either that 'it is useful because it is true' or that 'it is true because it is useful'"
* **Truth storage**: "We store such extra truths away in our memories, and with the overflow we fill our books of reference"
*   Ready for when they become "practically relevant to one of our emergencies"{.smaller}

::: {.notes}
- "Both these phrases mean exactly the same thing"
:::

# 5: Social Nature of Truth
**All Human Thinking Gets 'Discursified'**
* **Social construction**: "We exchange ideas; we lend and borrow verifications, get them from one another by means of social intercourse"
* **Verbal truth building**: "All truth thus gets verbally built out, stored up, and made available for everyone"

# Social Nature of Truth: consequences

* **Consistency requirements**:
  * "We must talk consistently just as we must think consistently"
  * "We mustn't now call Abel 'Cain' or Cain 'Abel'"

* **Systematic consequences**:
  * "We ungear ourselves from the book of Genesis, and from all its connections with the universe of speech and fact"
  * "We throw ourselves out of whatever truth that whole system may embody"

# 6: Reality as Collective Construct: From Individual Experience to Shared Reality

* **Direct vs indirect evidence**:
* Twin Towers example: "We all know they were real... but how do we know it?"
* "We saw images, but the key point here is that we chose to trust"

* **Verification delegation**:
* "Different sources send different images showing the same event from different angles"
* "Strictly speaking, it's a delegation of verification. I do not verify anything"

# Reality as Collective Construct: The asymmetry
(a proposal)
* First: Reality is built by the sum of subjective truths
* Then: When some truth is validated we compare it with reality
* Circularity? No.
* The collective reality is not the personal reality.

* **Reality as collective conscious archetype**: I is everywhere, in everything, but you can't really see it"


# 7: Pragmatist vs Rationalist Debate: Static vs Dynamic Conceptions

* **Rationalist position**:
* Truth "absolutely obtains, being a unique relation that does not wait upon any process"
* "Shoots straight over the head of experience, and hits its reality every time"
* Truth's quality is "timeless, like all essences and natures"
* "You pragmatists put the cart before the horse"


# Pragmatist vs Rationalist Debate: James's response

* Rationalists treat verification as mere "signs of its being"
* "Merely our lame ways of ascertaining, after the fact"
* "Truth is made... in the course of experience"
* "Truths emerge from facts; but they dip forward into facts again"
* **Fundamental difference**: "Pragmatism faces forward to the future, while rationalism face backward to a past eternity"

# 8: Two Types of Truth: Matters of Fact vs. Relations Among Ideas

* **Empirical truths**: Require sense-verification, can change
* "If I am lost in the woods... it is of utmost importance that I should think of a human habitation"
* Objects: concrete things, dates, places, distances
* **Logical/Mathematical truths**: "Eternal character" - once true, always true
* "1 and 1 make 2... white differs less from gray than from black"
* Objects: mental concepts, abstract relations

# Two Types of Truth: Key insight

* Both involve "leading" but different verification processes
  * Empirical: lead to sensible experiences
  * Logical: lead through abstract idea systems

# 9: Truth as "Leading": The Guidance Metaphor

* **Core concept**: "True ideas are those that we can validate, corroborate and verify"
* **Leading that pays**: Truth guides us toward valuable experiences
  * "Any idea that helps us deal with either the reality or its belongings... will agree sufficiently"
  * "Leading that is useful because it is into quarters that contain objects that are important"

# Truth as "Leading": Multiple forms of leading

* Direct: toward sensible objects themselves
* Indirect: toward "useful verbal and conceptual quarters"
* Social: toward "consistency, stability and flowing human intercourse"
* **Bottom line**: "Agreement turns out to be essentially an affair of leading"

# 10: The "Ante Rem" Fallacy
**Truth Exists in Processes, Not as Pre-existing Essence**

* **Rationalist error**: Treating truth as existing "before the thing" (ante rem)
* Like saying rich people are rich because they possess "wealth essence"

# The "Ante Rem" Fallacy: James's analogies

* **Wealth**: "name for concrete processes that certain men's lives play a part in"
* **Health**: "name for processes, as digestion, circulation, sleep"
* **Truth**: exists only in verification activities, not as separate quality

# The "Ante Rem" Fallacy: James's analogies: Habit vs. Act distinction

* Truth "becomes a habit of certain of our ideas... in their intervals of rest"
* "But that verification activity is the root of the whole matter"

* **Key quote**: "Truth exists ante rem just as much and as little as the other things do"

# 11: "Absolutely True" as Ideal
**The Regulative Function of Perfect Truth**

* **Definition**: "What no further experience will ever alter"

* **Status**: "Ideal vanishing-point towards which we imagine all our temporary truths will some day converge"
* Like "perfectly wise man" or "absolutely complete experience"
* "May never fully eventuate or materialize"

 # 11: "Absolutely True" as Ideal: Practical consequences

* **Practical consequence**: "We have to live today by what truth we can get today, and be ready tomorrow to call it falsehood"
* **Historical examples**:
  * "Ptolemaic astronomy, Euclidean space, Aristotelian logic... were expedient for centuries"
  * Now "only relatively true, or true within those borders of experience"
* **Retrospective judgment**: "We live forwards... but we understand backwards"

# 12: Defense Against Subjectivism: The accusation

* *: Critics say pragmatists "put foolishness and wisdom on one level"
* "Think that by saying whatever you find it pleasant to say and calling it truth you fulfill every pragmatistic requirement"

# 12: Defense Against Subjectivism: James's response
**Pragmatism is Not "Anything Goes"**

* **Objective constraints on pragmatists**:
  * "Pent in... between the whole body of funded truths squeezed from the past"
  * "And the coercions of the world of sense about him"
  * "Who so well as he feels the immense pressure of objective control?"

# Defense Against Subjectivism: Expedient ≠ Pleasant

* "Expedient in the long run and on the whole"
* Must "mediate between all previous truths and certain new experiences"
* "Must lead to some sensible terminus or other that can be verified exactly"

# Final point:

* "In this field of truth it is the pragmatists... who are the more genuine defenders of the universe's rationality"
