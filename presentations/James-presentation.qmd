# 1. The Agreement Problem

## What Does "Agreement with Reality" Mean?

* **Traditional definition**: Truth means ideas "agree" with reality, falsity means "disagreement"

* Both pragmatists and intellectualists accept this starting point

::: {.notes}
Intelectualists do not map to a clear thinking current, it refers to any approach which claims truth can be pbtain exclusively by theoretical means.
:::

## Agreement with Reality: the copying model fails

* Works for simple sensible things: "Shut your eyes and think of yonder clock on the wall, and you get just such a true picture or copy of its dial"
* Breaks down for abstract concepts: "Your idea of its 'works'... is much less of a copy, yet it passes muster"

::: {.notes}
Here is the old problem of the "concept", what is a concept?
:::

## Agreement with Reality: abstract realities resist copying

* "Past time," "power," "spontaneity" - "how can our mind copy such realities?"
* Even "time-keeping function" or "spring's elasticity" - "hard to see exactly what your ideas can copy"
* **The core question**: "Where our ideas cannot copy definitely their object, what does agreement with that object mean?"

::: {.notes}
Somewhat unclear if we're talking about "agreement with objects" or predicates
:::

# 2: Truth as Dynamic Process: truth happens to an idea

* **Against static conception**:
* Intellectualists: "truth means essentially an inert static relation"
* "When you've got your true idea of anything, there's an end of the matter"

::: {.notes}
We can trace back to this conception the idea that truth is "some sort of object" like in "ultimate truth"
:::

## Truth as Dynamic Process: James's alternative

* **Truth is dynamic and active**
* "The truth of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent in it"
* "Truth happens to an idea. It becomes true, is made true by events"

* **Process terminology**:
* "Its verity is in fact an event, a process... of its verifying itself"
* "Its validity is the process of its valid-ation"

::: {.notes}
A sentence in itself has no truth value. Its truth value is always built by interaction, not only with the external world, but also with our own system of beliefs.
:::

## Truth as Dynamic Process: James's alternative: Pragmatic question
* "What concrete difference will its being true make in anyone's actual life?"

::: {.notes}
Up to now we're mostly talking verificationsim and the argument was hard to discerne from an apiricist one. (empiricism and pragmatism have all the "verification" part common)
:::

# 3: Direct vs Indirect Verification
* **Direct verification**:
* Lost in woods example: "If I am lost in the woods and starved, and find what looks like a cow-path"
* Success criterion: "if I do so and follow it, I save myself"

::: {.notes}
Or maybe it's a wolf trail to their den?
:::

# Direct vs Indirect Verification: indirect verification
* **Indirect verification dominates**:
* 	[Clock example: "no one of us has seen the hidden works that make it one"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
* 	["We let our notion pass for true without attempting to verify"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}

::: {.notes}
Most of what we take as true we never verify
:::

## Direct vs Indirect Verification: the credit system of truth

* "Truth lives, in fact, for the most part on a credit system"
* "Our thoughts and beliefs 'pass' so long as nothing challenges them, just as bank notes pass"
* "You accept my verification of one thing, I yours of another"
* **Foundation needed**: "All this points to direct face-to-face verifications somewhere, without which the fabric of truth collapses"

::: {.notes}
This money analogy is very powerfull. As money, truth relies on credibility and trust.
:::

# 4: Truth's Practical Value: Cash Value?

* **Instrumental nature**: "The possession of truth... is only a preliminary means towards other vital satisfactions"
* **Practical importance**:
  * ["We live in a world of realities that can be infinitely useful or infinitely harmful"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
  * ["Ideas that tell us which of them to expect count as the true ideas"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}

::: {.notes}
"cash value" are James's words.
primitive pragmatism - it may work for animals too!
:::

## Truth's Practical Value: value equation
* "You can say of it then either that 'it is useful because it is true' or that 'it is true because it is useful'"
* **Truth storage**: "We store such extra truths away in our memories, and with the overflow we fill our books of reference"
*   [Ready for when they become "practically relevant to one of our emergencies"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}

::: {.notes}
- "Both these phrases mean exactly the same thing, 'true iff useful' "
:::

## 5: Social Nature of Truth
**All Human Thinking Gets 'Discursified'**

* **Social construction**: "We exchange ideas; we lend and borrow verifications, get them from one another by means of social intercourse"
* **Verbal truth building**: "All truth thus gets verbally built out, stored up, and made available for everyone"

::: {.notes}
There is o powerfull idea here. Modern "The Social Construction of Reality" of Berger and Luckmann: reality is a social construct
:::

## Social Nature of Truth: consequences
* **Consistency requirements**:
  * [We must talk consistently just as we must think consistently]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
  * [We mustn't now call Abel 'Cain' or Cain 'Abel']{style="font-size: 0.7em"}

* **Systematic consequences**:
  * ["[Iff] we ungear ourselves from the book of Genesis, and from all its connections with the universe of speech and fact"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
  * ["[then] we throw ourselves out of whatever truth that whole system may embody"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}

::: {.notes}
The Bible example is telling: it is not about The Book truth status, but about the collective social truths that embeded into our beliefs, texts, culture etc, derived from The Bible.
:::

# 6: Reality as Collective Construct
(a proposal)

* **Direct vs indirect evidence**:
* [Twin Towers example: "We all know they were real... but how do we know it?"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
* ["We saw images, but the key point here is that we chose to trust"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}

* **Verification delegation**:
* ["Different sources send different images showing the same event from different angles"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
* ["Strictly speaking, it's a delegation of verification. I do not verify anything"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"} 

::: {.notes}
"Reality" often ammounts to "Truth of the proposition describing a MoF".
We delegate most of the verification of truth to the credibility of our sources
Remember school, it's build on this ideea that the teachers cannot lie.
:::

## Reality as Collective Construct: The asymmetry
(a proposal)

* First: Reality is built by the sum of subjective truths
* Then: When some truth is validated we compare it with reality
* Circularity? No.
* The collective reality is not the personal reality.

* **Reality as collective conscious archetype**: I is everywhere, in everything, but you can't really see it"

::: {.notes}
An archetype is by definition a sort of 'matrix' to describe something we don't have direct access to but we know only by its effects. 'Energy' for instance is an archetypal concept.
Collective Unconscious Archetypes of Jung function more like 'fileds of force' guiding all individual psyche along its lines. Its individual manifestation is personal (in dreams and behavior) but its nature is collective.
To this effect, Reality as a Conscious Archetype is some sort of consiously accepted 'field of force' that we all align to.
:::

# 7: Pragmatist vs Rationalist: Rationalist position

* Truth "absolutely obtains, being a unique relation that does not wait upon any process"
  * ["Shoots straight over the head of experience, and hits its reality every time"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
  * [Truth's quality is "timeless, like all essences and natures"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
  * ["You pragmatists put the cart before the horse"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}

::: {.notes}
Back to James
:::


## Pragmatist vs Rationalist Debate: James's response
* Rationalists treat verification as mere "signs of its being"
* "Merely our lame ways of ascertaining, after the fact"
* "Truth is made... in the course of experience"
* "Truths emerge from facts; but they dip forward into facts again"
* **Fundamental difference**: "Pragmatism faces forward to the future, while rationalism face backward to a past eternity"

::: {.notes}

:::

# 8: Two Types of Truth: MoF vs. RAI
* **Empirical truths**: Require sense-verification, can change
  * ["If I am lost in the woods... it is of utmost importance that I should think of a human habitation"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
* [Objects: concrete things, dates, places, distances]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
* **Logical/Mathematical truths**: "Eternal character" - once true, always true
  *[ "1 and 1 make 2... white differs less from gray than from black"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
  * [Objects: mental concepts, abstract relations]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}

::: {.notes}

:::

## Two Types of Truth: Key insight
* Both involve "leading" but different verification processes
  * Empirical: lead to sensible experiences
  * Logical: lead through abstract idea systems

::: {.notes}

:::

# 9: Truth as "Leading": The Guidance Metaphor
* **Core concept**: "True ideas are those that we can validate, corroborate and verify"
* **Leading that pays**: Truth guides us toward valuable experiences
  * ["Any idea that helps us deal with either the reality or its belongings... will agree sufficiently"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
  * ["Leading that is useful because it is into quarters that contain objects that are important"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}

::: {.notes}
Here the analogy with the "force field" of Reality works again
:::

## Truth as "Leading": Multiple forms of leading
* Direct: toward sensible objects themselves
* Indirect: toward "useful verbal and conceptual quarters"
* Social: toward "consistency, stability and flowing human intercourse"
* **Bottom line**: "Agreement turns out to be essentially an affair of leading"

::: {.notes}

:::

# 10: The "Ante Rem" Fallacy
**Truth Exists in Processes, Not as Pre-existing Essence**

* **Rationalist error**: Treating truth as existing "before the thing" (ante rem)
* Like saying rich people are rich because they possess "wealth essence"

::: {.notes}

:::

## The "Ante Rem" Fallacy: James's analogies
* **Wealth**: "name for concrete processes that certain men's lives play a part in"
* **Health**: "name for processes, as digestion, circulation, sleep"
* **Truth**: exists only in verification activities, not as separate quality

::: {.notes}

:::

## The "Ante Rem" Fallacy: Habit vs. Act distinction
* Truth "becomes a habit of certain of our ideas... in their intervals of rest"
* "But that verification activity is the root of the whole matter"

* **Key quote**: "Truth exists ante rem just as much and as little as the other things do"

::: {.notes}

:::

# 11: "Absolutely True" as Ideal
**The Regulative Function of Perfect Truth**

* **Definition**: "What no further experience will ever alter"
* **Status**: "Ideal vanishing-point towards which we imagine all our temporary truths will some day converge"
* Like "perfectly wise man" or "absolutely complete experience"
* "May never fully eventuate or materialize"

::: {.notes}

:::

## "Absolutely True" as Ideal: consequences
* **Practical consequence**: "We have to live today by what truth we can get today, and be ready tomorrow to call it falsehood"
* **Historical examples**:
  * ["Ptolemaic astronomy, Euclidean space, Aristotelian logic... were expedient for centuries"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
  * [Now "only relatively true, or true within those borders of experience"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
* **Retrospective judgment**: "We live forwards... but we understand backwards"

::: {.notes}

:::

# 12: Defense Against Subjectivism: The accusation
* Critics say pragmatists "put foolishness and wisdom on one level"
* "Think that by saying whatever you find it pleasant to say and calling it truth you fulfill every pragmatistic requirement"

::: {.notes}

:::

## Defense Against Subjectivism: James's response
**Pragmatism is Not "Anything Goes"**

* **Objective constraints on pragmatists**:
  * ["Pent in... between the whole body of funded truths squeezed from the past"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
  * ["And the coercions of the world of sense about him"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}
  * ["Who so well as he feels the immense pressure of objective control?"]{style="font-size: 0.7em"}

::: {.notes}

:::

## Defense Against Subjectivism: Expedient ≠ Pleasant
* "Expedient in the long run and on the whole"
* Must "mediate between all previous truths and certain new experiences"
* "Must lead to some sensible terminus or other that can be verified exactly"

::: {.notes}

:::

# Final point:
#  "In this field of truth it is the pragmatists... who are the more genuine defenders of the universe's rationality"
