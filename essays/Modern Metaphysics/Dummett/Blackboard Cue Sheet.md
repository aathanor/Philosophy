## 🎓 Blackboard Cue Sheet — Dummett’s Realism (Seminar)

### 🎯 Anchoring Example

At top center:

```
"Somewhere in the woods, a mushroom is growing."
∃x (InWoods(x) ∧ Mushroom(x) ∧ Growing(x))
```

Box this. Tell the group: this is the sentence we’ll follow through Dummett’s argument.

---

### 🟥 Drawing 1: Realism vs Anti-Realism

Split the board vertically.

**Left: Realism**

```
- Truth exists independently of verification
- Sentence is true or false, even if we can’t ever know
- Meaning = truth-conditions
- Classical logic: bivalence, excluded middle

Sentence → Reference → World → Truth
```

**Right: Anti-Realism (Dummett)**

```
- Truth-value only if verifiable (even in principle)
- If mushroom can’t be found, sentence has no truth-value
- Meaning = verification condition
- Intuitionistic logic: assertibility, non-bivalence

Sentence → Verification → Use → Truth
```

---

### 🧪 Drawing 2: Semantic Composition of the Sentence

Under the sentence formula:

```
∃x (InWoods(x) ∧ Mushroom(x) ∧ Growing(x))
```

List predicates with semantic value types:

```
InWoods(x)   → subset of domain D (locations)
Mushroom(x)  → set of mushrooms in D
Growing(x)   → current state, true/false or provable
```

Comment: Truth depends on how these sets are defined—either as classical extensions or constructive conditions.

### 📐 Drawing 3: Logic Comparison Table

Draw a horizontal table (simplified):

| Logic          | Truth of ∃x (…x…)                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Classical      | True if any x ∈ D satisfies all        |
| Intuitionistic | True only if such x can be constructed |

Note below:

> In classical logic, truth is defined model-theoretically. In intuitionistic logic, truth = verifiability.

---

### 🔁 Drawing 4: Meaning–Semantic Value–Truth Cycle

On the side, triangle or cycle:

```
     MEANING
     ↑     ↓
SEMANTIC VALUE
     ↑     ↓
     TRUTH
```

Arrows:

- Meaning determines semantic value (rules of use)
- Semantic value determines truth (via theory)
- If the truth-conditions of a sentence are not known—or cannot in principle be articulated—then its meaning is not determined.

Meaning requires truth to be **explainable**, not necessarily known.



---

### 🚫 Drawing 5: Reductionism Fails

Far right or lower board space.

Try to reduce:

> "There could be an experience of finding a mushroom in the woods."

Then ask: Can we eliminate the vocabulary of "mushroom", "woods", or "growing"?

Write conclusion:

```
- Reductive class presupposes original class
- No elimination = no translation = no semantic explanation
- Reference becomes idle → reductionism fails
```

---

### ✅ Final Wrap-Up Prompt

Return to the top sentence:

> "Somewhere in the woods, a mushroom is growing."

Ask:

- What makes this statement meaningful?
- Can it be true without ever being known?
- If not, what is left of its meaning?

Quote to end:

> "Truth is only meaningful where understanding is possible." — Dummett


## 🖍️ Blackboard Cue Sheet — Sophisticated Realism vs Anti-Realist Reduction (Mushroom Example)

---

### 🪧 Top Center: Anchor Sentence
```
“There is a mushroom growing in the woods.”
∃x (InWoods(x) ∧ Mushroom(x) ∧ Growing(x))
```
Label: **Statement from the Disputed Class**

---

### ⬅️ Left Panel: Anti-Realist Reduction
**Title**: Reduction to Experience (Phenomenalist)
```
“There could be an experience of seeing a mushroom-like shape
in a wooded area, displaying growth-like variation.”
```

🛑 Objections:
- Parasitic on original concepts (mushroom, growth)
- Reference idle: no link to real world object
- Meaning based on perspective, not compositional truth

➡️ Conclusion: **Mild Anti-Realism**
- Keeps bivalence? ✅ (maybe)
- Keeps reference? ❌
- Preserves truth-conditions? ❌

---

### ➡️ Right Panel: Sophisticated Realist Reduction
**Title**: Reduction to Biological-Causal Framework
```
“There exists a localized region of forest substrate
with sufficient nutrients and moisture,
where fungal mycelium governed by growth function F(x, t)
produces a fruiting body at time t₀.”
```

✅ Properties:
- Reference preserved: fruiting body = mushroom
- Truth-conditions tied to objective causal conditions
- Meaning derived via functional-biological translation

➡️ Conclusion: **Sophisticated Realism**
- Keeps bivalence? ✅
- Keeps reference? ✅
- Preserves truth-conditions? ✅

---

### 🧠 Bottom Summary (Center Panel)
```
Dummett: A reductive thesis may support realism if:
- Reference is preserved
- Truth-conditions are explained
- Vocabulary is not merely displaced but grounded

→ Sophisticated Realism = Realism + Reduction
→ Anti-Realism = Reduction that undermines reference or truth
```
