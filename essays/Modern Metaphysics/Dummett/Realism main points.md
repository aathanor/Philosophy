## 🔹 1. Reframing Realism as a Semantic Thesis

* Dummett shifts the realism debate from metaphysical claims (“Do Xs exist?”) to **semantic claims about language**:
  > Realism is about what **renders statements true**—it concerns the kind of **truth** applicable to statements in a given class.
***

## 🔹 2. The Disputed Class

* Realism isn’t about all language, but about **some class of statements** (e.g. about the past, mathematics, ethics).
* The key question becomes:
  > _Are statements in this class determinately true or false, independently of our ability to verify them?_
***

## 🔹 3.  Realism Implies Bivalence and Classical Logic

* To be a realist about a class of statements is to uphold:
  * The **principle of bivalence**: every statement is either true or false.
  * The **law of excluded middle**: ¬¬P ⇒ P.
* Thus, realism carries a commitment to **classical logic**.
***

## 🔹 4. Semantic Theory Is Not Theory of Meaning

* A **semantic theory** explains how the truth of a sentence is determined **compositionally** from the semantic values of its parts.
* But this is not the same as a **theory of meaning**—meaning concerns what a competent speaker **knows**.
* Still, Dummett argues:
  > A semantic theory must provide a foundation for a theory of meaning, or it is semantically implausible.
***

## 🔹 5. Meaning Requires Truth-Conditions to Be Epistemically Accessible

* A speaker’s understanding of a sentence must involve knowing **what would make it true**.
* This doesn’t require knowing _whether_ it’s true, but it does require that **truth be explainable** within a semantic framework.
* Therefore, if truth is entirely **inaccessible**, **meaning collapses**.
***

## 🔹 6. Model-Theoretic vs Proof-Theoretic Semantics

* Classical semantics: meaning via **truth in a model**, using reference and extensions.
* Intuitionistic semantics: meaning via **verification/proof**, not reference.
* This shows that **different logics give different semantic values**, hence different theories of meaning.
***

## 🔹 7. Challenge to Realism via Quantification

* Classical logic treats quantified statements (e.g., ∀x φ(x)) as having definite truth-values—even over **infinite or uncheckable domains**.
* But Dummett asks: _What makes such statements true if we can’t, even in principle, verify them?___
* This motivates the shift to **intuitionistic logic** and **anti-realism**.
***

## 🔹 8. Critique of Frege and Tarski

* Frege assumes realism by default—every thought has a truth-value.
* Tarski gives a formal truth-definition, but avoids the epistemic question: _how do we access the domain?___
* Dummett insists: a semantic theory must **connect truth and meaning** through **epistemically accessible conditions**.
