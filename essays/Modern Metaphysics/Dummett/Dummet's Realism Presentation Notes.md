## On Dummet
- one of the most important of his time
- "specialized" in Frege
- devout catholic
- the problem of "Realism" links into many subsequent păroblems and lots of articles. It is a complex subject

## At the core: Semantic Theory (ST) and Meaning?

We need to clarify some concepts from the beggining. Why? Because the individual understanding of concepts is based on the "internal" web of beliefs of each of us which, most of the time, is not identical. Disputes stem mostly from this hidden fact.

- knowing the truth of a sentence does not means, generally, that we get its meaning
- ultimately is about connecting truth and meaning. How?
- in 2 value logic, things are clear
- but the same sentence can be formulated and read using other logics: intuitionistic, modal etc

- a ST determines the rules of composionality: from the truth of the parts to the truth of the sentence. It gives an inference model to get from true premises to true conclusions.
    - Frege: realist ST, two value logic: true or false, the principle of bivalence (Frege didn't explicetly uses "ST")
    - Dummett: proof-based, intuitionistic logic: true or not true (which is to say, indetermined but not true)
- Semantic Value (SV): every simple expression is assigned one, specific to the logic used:
    - Names and Constants: in both classical and intuitionistic logic, are individuals in the domain D
    - Atomic sentences: true or flase in classical logic, provable or not in intuitionistic logic.
- Meaning:


1. **What exactly is realism (before Dummet)?**
    1. Problem of Universals: realism/nominalism 
    2. Epistemological view: realism/idealism
    3. Scientific view: realism/instrumentalism
    4. Mathematics: realism/platonism

   There is a shift, from metaphysics to semantics (or more from **truth-conditions understood metaphysically** to truth-conditions understood **epistemically** or **linguistically**): what is real independently of our conscience observing it and what sentences are true independently of our mind assesing them.
   
2. **How is Dummet framing the problem?**
    1. He's coming more from the Philosophy of Language: what is real is described in propositions about the world. Not classical Metaphysics or Epistemology but PoL.
    2. An example "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"
        1. Classical (epistemological) realism:
            1. **realism**: "_Yes, of course it makes a sound._ Because the world continues to behave according to physical laws whether or not someone is there to perceive it."
            2. **idealism**: "_The notion of “sound” involves perception_, so without a perceiver, there is no sound—just air pressure changes."
        2. In Dummett’s framing, semantic _realism_ would hold that the proposition has a truth-value even if verification is impossible. Semantic _anti-realism_ denies this.
            1. **realism**: it is meaningful because it has truth value independent of verification
            2. **anti-realist**: no, it has no determinate truth value unless it is possible to verify it so that it is meaningless.(i.e. one can utter it but it does not have too much sense)
3. **There is one sticky point in understanding Dummet's view**:

    1. Some of his critics claim that Realism has nothing to do with truth. ("Common-sense physical entities objectively exist independently of the mental."[Michael Devitt, pg.76]")
    2. But the problem is that said existence cannot be even claimed or discussed **outside** language; we need to use language to claim existence and once we do it, the truth value of the sentence claiming existence becomes essential and, in the Fregean sense, identical with the meaning of the claim.
    3. It si important then to keep in mind that Dummett's not preopcupied with existence but with the way we attach meaning to existence claims. 
               
4. **Dummett's definition of Realism**:

   The key point is that realism can be claimed over an "abstract" domain (ethics, future, mathematics), so that realism can be seen as a certain interpretation "of statements in a given class". For Dummett, it is realism about the meaning, not about the world. In his 1978 book (where there is a chapter "Realism", he says:

   > "A dispute over a Realism can be described linguistically as being over the question whether certain expressions—general terms, or names of material objects—genuinely have a reference.")
 
 Other key quotes:
    
    > “So construed, realism is a semantic thesis, a thesis about what, in general, renders a statement in **the given class** true when it is true.” [p.55]

    > "For these reasons, I shall take as my preferred characterisation of a dispute  between realists and anti-realists one which represents it as relating, not to  a class of entities or a class of terms, but to a class of statements, which may  be, e.g., statements about the physical world, statements about mental  events, processes or states, mathematical statements, statements in the past  tense, statements in the future tense, etc. This class I shall, from now on,  term ‘**the disputed class**’." [1978, p.146]
 
 > "The dispute [between realists and anti-realists] thus concerns the notion of truth appropriate for  statements of the disputed class; and this means that it is a dispute concerning  the kind of meaning which these statements have." [1978, p.146]

- Realism implies the "principle of bivalence" & "the principle of the excluded middle", the truth value cannot be indeterminate
- It follows that realism about a class of statments implies the aplicability of classical logic to that class
- Rejecting realism seems to imply the rejection of classical logic (and maybe this is why realism seems intuitively correct)
    and the replacement by intuitionist logic - provability & constructive proof.
- If one can prove that classical logic cannot uphold bivalence on statements in a domain, that undermines realism about statements in that domain.
  
    1. It is important to note that Dummet's anti-realism is not some sort of contrasting idealism, but a re-definition of what it means to understand a statement; i.e. an answer to the question "when statements have meaning?". This is inevitably connected to the verifiability of the statement's truth value.

    2. The reasoning goes like this:
  - metaphysic/epistemic realism -> semantic realsim -> truth -> first order logic -> quantifying over a domain -> quantifying over infinite domains -> lack of justification

5. **The Role of Quantifiers**:
    *    because of the principle of bivalence and excluded middle, a statement in a given class can be, in principle, formulated in a logical form involving quantifiers, logical constants ad bounded variables.
    *    but there is a verifiability problem in this case.
    *    mathematical realism will asume that any mathematical statement is true or false even if we do not know it. For a known one, like "For any x real number, x^2>0" we can construct a proof, eventualy. But for an unknown one, of general form "For any x real number, so and so" no proof is possible. How we determine its truth value?
    *    what we'll use is some sort of induction, and we supose that by passing through all real numbers we find some sort of truth value; only that universal quantification over inifinite domains is not checkable.
      
6. **The clash with Frege and Tarski**
    *    here a clash with both Tarski and Frege becomes apparent: Dummett critiques both Frege and Tarski for their assumptions about natural language: Frege for assuming realism (every well formed thought is a member of the "Third Realm"; basically accepting bivalence without any justification), and Tarski for treating the truth as dependend on model, without questioning how we get it or how we can access its elements (in the domain). So, Frege takes realism as a given while Tarski asks no question about the accesibility of a domain over which a certain sentence is claimed to be true.
    *    For Tarski, “There exists an x such that P(x)” is true if there is such an x in D. But what would count as such an x when I know absolutely nothing about the content of P(x)? (Also, for all x ≤ 1000, P(x)” is different from “For all x ∈ ℕ, P(x).)
)
    *    Dummett is not preocupied with truth values but with meaning. If meaning is use, then logical truth floating free besides epistemic access has no meaning. In a certain way, Frege and Tarski give us _truth_ without _understanding_; Dummett seeks a notion of truth that is accessible to understanding.

7. **Semantic theory, semantic value and meaning**:

   * **Semantic Theory** => a formal theory that explains how the truth (or assertibility) of sentences is compositionally determined from the values of their parts. (formal model of truth)
   * **Meaning** => what a speaker knows (or is capable of using, depends on speaker competence)
   * **Semantic value** => what the theory needs to assign to explain truth
   * **Truth** => what the sentence has (in a model, or in intuitionistic terms, when proven)

-----
    * A semantic theory determines truth, not meaning
    * Semantic value is the mechanism by which a sentence is determined true or not
    * In intuitionistic semamtic intuitionistic logic is used, not classical logic, so that semantic values are different
    * This is a non-realistic sematic theory: weaker principle - true or non-true (as compared to true or false): objectivist sematics
    * Meaning and semantic value:
        * > It follows that a grasp of the meaning of a specific expression must be something which, taken together with the way the world is, determines the particular semantic value that is has.Thus meaning must be something that determines semantic value: in Frege's terminology, sense determines reference.

8. **semantig values and meaning**
   * Dummett says that meaning determines (or better said 'imposes') certain semantic values
   * but semantic values come in 'sets', depending on the logical system employed to determine truth
   * **Semantic values are typed and system-specific.******
       *  Each logic defines its own permissible assignments of values to expression types.
       *  These cannot be mixed without violating the compositional integrity of the semantic system.

	### Semantic Values by Expression Type and Theory

| **Expression Type**    | **Classical Semantics** (Tarskian)                                         | **Proof-Theoretic / Use-Based Semantics** (Dummettian)                           |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Proper Name**        | An **individual** in the domain \( D \)                                    | A **procedure** or **rule** for identifying the referent (e.g., pointing, criteria) |
| **Constant**           | As above: a fixed **object** in the domain                                 | Rule for using the term in appropriate contexts (e.g., “when x is observable as…”) |
| **Variable**           | Value given by an **assignment function** \( g(x) \in D \)                 | Placeholder for a term; assertibility depends on instantiation or context        |
| **1-place Predicate**  | A **set** of individuals \( P \subseteq D \), or a function \( D \to \{T,F\} \) | A **rule** for applying the predicate: “x counts as P iff…” (assertibility condition) |
| **n-place Predicate**  | An **n-ary relation** over \( D^n \)                                       | Rule for asserting when n items stand in the relation                            |
| **Function Symbol**    | A **function** \( f: D^n \to D \)                                          | Instructional rule for computing outputs from inputs                             |
| **Atomic Sentence**    | **True** or **false**, depending on satisfaction (e.g., \( P(a) \))         | Assertible or not, depending on whether conditions for asserting it are met      |
| **Complex Sentence**   | **Truth-value**, compositional from parts (e.g., \( a \in P \))             | Assertibility status derived from justification rules for parts                  |
| **Quantified Sentence**| **True** iff all / some assignments satisfy the open formula               | Assertible iff a proof exists (∃x) or a general derivation (∀x) can be exhibited |
| **Logical Connectives**| **Truth-functions**: ∧, ∨, ¬, etc., operate on truth values                | **Inference rules**: what follows from what; introduction/elimination rules      |
| **Sentence as whole**  | Semantic value = **truth-value**                                           | Semantic value = **proof condition** or **assertibility condition**              |

- In the end, semantic values also determine meaning.
 - **Meaning and semantic value stand in a relation of bidirectional determinacy**:

 For any sentence, a grasp of its meaning determines which semantic values must be assigned to its parts under a given semantic theory, and conversely, a full assignment of semantic values determines the meaning the sentence can have within that theory.

 
9. **meaning and truth conditions**
   * Wittgenstein's example on pain:
   * **Understanding a sentence does not consist in grasping its truth-conditions.**
   * A semantic theory based on classical logic is not working, we need something different (use-based model?)
10. **reductionisms abandons reference**
    * **mild anti-realism**: Keeps truth-conditions and bivalence; **abandons reference** for certain terms  (e.g., phenomenalism, Frege’s hypothetical example of directions)

    * **Radical Anti-Realism**: Rejects both truth-conditions and bivalence;(e.g. Wittgenstein on inner sensation ascriptions; constructivism in mathematics)
