### Semantic Values by Expression Type and Theory

| **Expression Type**    | **Classical Semantics** (Tarskian)                                         | **Proof-Theoretic / Use-Based Semantics** (Dummettian)                           |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Proper Name**        | An **individual** in the domain \( D \)                                    | A **procedure** or **rule** for identifying the referent (e.g., pointing, criteria) |
| **Constant**           | As above: a fixed **object** in the domain                                 | Rule for using the term in appropriate contexts (e.g., “when x is observable as…”) |
| **Variable**           | Value given by an **assignment function** \( g(x) \in D \)                 | Placeholder for a term; assertibility depends on instantiation or context        |
| **1-place Predicate**  | A **set** of individuals \( P \subseteq D \), or a function \( D \to \{T,F\} \) | A **rule** for applying the predicate: “x counts as P iff…” (assertibility condition) |
| **n-place Predicate**  | An **n-ary relation** over \( D^n \)                                       | Rule for asserting when n items stand in the relation                            |
| **Function Symbol**    | A **function** \( f: D^n \to D \)                                          | Instructional rule for computing outputs from inputs                             |
| **Atomic Sentence**    | **True** or **false**, depending on satisfaction (e.g., \( P(a) \))         | Assertible or not, depending on whether conditions for asserting it are met      |
| **Complex Sentence**   | **Truth-value**, compositional from parts (e.g., \( a \in P \))             | Assertibility status derived from justification rules for parts                  |
| **Quantified Sentence**| **True** iff all / some assignments satisfy the open formula               | Assertible iff a proof exists (∃x) or a general derivation (∀x) can be exhibited |
| **Logical Connectives**| **Truth-functions**: ∧, ∨, ¬, etc., operate on truth values                | **Inference rules**: what follows from what; introduction/elimination rules      |
| **Sentence as whole**  | Semantic value = **truth-value**                                           | Semantic value = **proof condition** or **assertibility condition**              |
