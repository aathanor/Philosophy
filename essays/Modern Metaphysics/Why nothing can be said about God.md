- [ ] Why nothing can be said about God

1. **Let us define** P\_n as the set containing all logical constants and predicates of a logic system L\_n, where L\_n is of order n (e.g., first-order logic, second-order logic, etc.).

2. **In any logic** L\_n, statements or predicates about P\_n (the logical structure of L\_n itself) cannot be made _within_ L\_n. They require a higher-order logic L\_{n+1}, whose expressive power exceeds that of L\_n. This follows standard results in logic and metalogic, such as Tarski’s undefinability of truth and the general limitation of self-reference in formal systems.

3. **Therefore**, for any order n, the logical apparatus P\_n can only be fully expressed, described, or predicated upon from a logic L\_{n+1} that transcends it.

4. Now, let us consider God as traditionally understood in theistic religions such as Christianity and Islam—as **omniscient**, **omnipresent**, and **omnipotent**. These attributes entail that:

   * God knows all that is (omniscience),

   * God is present in all that exists (omnipresence),

   * God is the sustaining cause and ground of all that exists and can exist (omnipotence).

5. From this it follows that **nothing—no structure, determination, form, or potentiality—can exist outside God**. For if it did:

   * God would not know it (violating omniscience),

   * God would not be present in it (violating omnipresence),

   * God would not sustain or control it (violating omnipotence).

6. In particular, this applies not only to material or created things, but also to **formal structures**—that is, to **the logical constants and predicates** of **all possible orders of logic**.

7. Therefore, **God must contain within Himself** the totality of all logical constants and predicates across all levels of logic—**everything that can be said, structured, or predicated at any level of formal reasoning**.

8. From this it follows that **no logic**—of any order—can predicate anything **about God** in the proper sense, because:

   * Any act of predication relies on logical constants and predicates that are **within** God.

   * To predicate something about God would require a logic that **transcends** all logical structures already contained in Him.

   * But since **all** possible predicates are already within God, **no such transcendental logic can exist**—there is no “outside” standpoint.

9. **Conclusion**: God, being the ground and totality of all logical forms, cannot be predicated upon within any formal system. **All predicates are within Him, and thus none can properly describe or contain Him.** Predication itself breaks down at the level of divine totality.
