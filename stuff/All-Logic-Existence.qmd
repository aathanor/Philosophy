title: "Why 'All Logic' can't be"

(this was written because I do not think 

::: epigraph
*"\"My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone
who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he
has used them---as steps---to climb up beyond them. (He must, so to
speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.) He must
transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright.\"'*

--- Wittgenstein, *Tractatus* 6.54

# The Basic Setup

- For any natural number $n$, let $L_n$ be a logic system of order $n$

- Let $P_n$ be **all** the semantic and syntactic components
  (predicates, constants, variables, quantifiers, models etc) available
  in $L_n$

- Let $\mathscr{P}$ represent **every possible semantic and syntactic
  components** across all systems:
  $\mathscr{P}= P_1 \cup P_2 \cup P_3 \cup \cdots$

# The Core Problem

- In any system $L_n$, we can *use* its \"tools\" $P_n$ freely

- But we *can't formally talk about* $P_n$ as a complete package within
  $L_n$ itself

# The Fatal Loop

Now consider $\mathscr{P}$ - the hypothetical collection of *all*
semantic and syntactic components from *all* systems. To claim
"$\mathscr{P}$ exists":

1.  You'd need to make this claim in some specific system $L_k$

2.  But $\mathscr{P}$ by definition includes tools from $L_{k+1}$,
    $L_{k+2}$, etc.

3.  These tools aren't available in your starting system $L_k$

4.  Therefore, $L_k$ can't actually formalize the full $\mathscr{P}$
    it's trying to describe

This amounts to the conclusion that there is no formal language in which
I can say \"$\mathscr{P}$ exists\".

# Conclusion

The very act of trying to say "All logic exists" (if by a \"logic\" we
understand the totality of its semantic and syntactic components,
regardless of its proof-theoretic and model-theoretic entailment) in any
particular logical system undermines itself. We're left with:

- Particular logics we can work with ($L_1$, $L_2$, etc.)

- Grand claims about "all logic" that forever escape formalization
