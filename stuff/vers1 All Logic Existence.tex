\epigraph{\textit{``"My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them—as steps—to climb up beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.)
He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright."'}}{--- Wittgenstein, \textit{Tractatus} 6.54}

\section{The Basic Setup}

\begin{itemize}
    \item For any natural number $n$, let $L_n$ be a logic system of order $n$
    \item Let $P_n$ be \textbf{all} the semantic and syntactic components (predicates, constants, variables, quantifiers, models etc) available in $L_n$
    \item Let $\Pround$ represent \textbf{every possible semantic and syntactic components} across all systems: $\Pround = P_1 \cup P_2 \cup P_3 \cup \cdots$
\end{itemize}

\section{The Core Problem}

\begin{itemize}
    \item In any system $L_n$, we can \textit{use} its "tools" $P_n$ freely
    \item But we \textit{can't formally talk about} $P_n$ as a complete package within $L_n$ itself
\end{itemize}

\section{The Fatal Loop}

Now consider $\Pround$ - the hypothetical collection of \textit{all} semantic and syntactic components from \textit{all} systems. To claim ``$\Pround$ exists'':

\begin{enumerate}
    \item You'd need to make this claim in some specific system $L_k$
    \item But $\Pround$ by definition includes tools from $L_{k+1}$, $L_{k+2}$, etc.
    \item These tools aren't available in your starting system $L_k$
    \item Therefore, $L_k$ can't actually formalize the full $\Pround$ it's trying to describe
\end{enumerate}

This amounts to the conclusion that there is no formal language in which I can say "$\Pround$ exists". 

\section{Conclusion}

The very act of trying to say ``All logic exists''  (if by a "logic" we understand the totality of its semantic and syntactic components, regardless of its proof-theoretic and model-theoretic entailment) in any particular logical system undermines itself. We're left with:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Particular logics we can work with ($L_1$, $L_2$, etc.)
    \item Grand claims about ``all logic'' that forever escape formalization
\end{itemize}
