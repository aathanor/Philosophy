<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>William James’s pragmatic theory of truth offers more than a novel account of verification—it reveals the fundamentally social and collective nature of truth itself. In “Pragmatism’s Conception of Truth,” James observes that truth “lives, in fact, for the most part on a credit system” where “we trade on each other’s truth.” This insight, while often overlooked in favor of his more famous “cash value” metaphor, points toward a profound transformation in how we understand the epistemological foundations of human knowledge. What emerges from James’s analysis is not merely a social constructivist account of truth, but something more architecturally fundamental: reality as a&nbsp;<strong>collective conscious archetype</strong>—a deliberately constructed social reality that mediates between individual experience and collective validation.</p>
<p>This essay argues that James’s credit system hints of a process where subjective truths aggregate into a collective concept of reality, which then serves as the validation standard for new truth claims. This process operates through what I term “truth-validation institutions”—concrete social mechanisms that allow us to consciously engage with and modify our collective truth standards. Unlike unconscious collective archetypes that determine behavior without recognition, reality operates as a conscious archetype that preserves rational agency while enabling social coordination. This framework explains both the stability and evolution of truth standards as tools to build reality, from everyday verification to scientific revolutions.</p>

<h1>James’s Social Verification: Beyond Individual Foundationalism</h1>
<p>James’s most radical insight lies not in his pragmatic definition of truth as “what works,” but in his recognition that individual verification is epistemologically impossible. As he observes, “the overwhelming majority of our true ideas admit of no direct or face-to-face verification—those of past history, for example, as of Cain and Abel.” The implications of this observation extend far beyond historical knowledge to the foundation of all human knowing.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> We cannot personally verify that Japan exists, that DNA contains genetic information, or that Shakespeare wrote Hamlet, yet these truths function as foundational elements of our knowledge.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;It appears that there is extensive literature in social epistemology, particularly (<a href="#ref-goldman1999">Goldman 1999</a>), which examines how social processes affect knowledge production. The concept of epistemic dependence seems to have been developed by philosophers like (<a href="#ref-coady1992">Coady 1992</a>) and (<a href="#ref-fricker1995">Fricker 1995</a>). Going in depth into these references is, however, beyond the scope of this essay.</p></div><div id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The analysis of truth-validation institutions seem to be present in studies and sociology of scientific knowledge, including work by (<a href="#ref-kitcher1993">Kitcher 1993</a>), (<a href="#ref-longino1990">Longino 1990</a>), and the broader literature on epistemic communities developed by scholars like (<a href="#ref-knorr-cetina1999">Knorr-Cetina 1999</a>); but as before, an in-depth research on this titles is beyond the scope of this essay, they are mentioned only as acknowledgment of other authors work on the subject and bibliography for further research.</p></div></div><p>This epistemic dependence operates through what James calls a “credit system” analogous to banking: “Our thoughts and beliefs ‘pass’ so long as nothing challenges them, just as bank notes pass so long as nobody refuses them.” But James’s insight goes deeper than mere analogy. Just as financial systems require institutional structures to maintain stability and trust, our epistemic credit system requires&nbsp;<strong>truth-validation institutions</strong>—peer review, academic publishing, journalistic standards, legal evidence procedures—that determine what counts as reliable testimony and valid verification.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The credit system reveals that truth emerges from collective processes rather than individual foundational experiences. Even the most direct personal experience—seeing the clock with our own eyes—presupposes truths - what is inside?- gained not from immediate experience alone but from our participation in shared standards of what constitutes valid observation. The very concepts of “seeing,” “evidence,” and “reliability” are tools of socially constructed frameworks that enable individual experience to contribute to collective knowledge and at the center of this framework is what we call “truth”.</p>
<p>This social verification network represents a departure from traditional foundationalist epistemology. Instead of seeking bedrock certainties in individual experience or reason, James shows that knowledge emerges from the dynamic interaction between personal verification and collective validation. Truth becomes not a property of isolated propositions but a quality that emerges from social processes of testimony, challenge, and institutional authentication.</p>

<h1>Truth and Reality</h1>
<section id="escaping-epistemic-circularity" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="escaping-epistemic-circularity">Escaping Epistemic Circularity</h2>
<p>The social nature of truth validation immediately raises the specter of vicious circularity: if truth depends on reality (collective validation), and reality depends on prior truths, how do we avoid the conclusion that truth is arbitrary, simply whatever a community happens to believe? This challenge has led some to the rejection of social accounts of truth as relativistic<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and also others to point to related types of circularity, like Russel does in (<a href="#ref-russell1966">Russell 1966</a>) when showing that utility and truth seem to justify each other<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> . However, the circularity between truth and reality is a different one, and James’s framework suggests a solution through what I call the&nbsp;<strong>asymmetry feature</strong>.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;This type of objection appears mostly in various critiques of Coherentism which one of the natural evolutions of the “social truth” concept as presented in James’s essay.</p></div><div id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;<em>“And if the pragmatist states that utility is to be merely a criterion of truth, we shall reply first, that it is not a useful criterion, because it is usually harder to discover whether a belief is useful than whether it is true; secondly, that since no a priori reason is shown why truth and utility should always go together, utility can only be shown to be a criterion at all by showing inductively that it accompanies truth in all known instances, which requires that we should already know in many instances what things are true”</em></p></div></div><p>The key insight lies in recognizing that the processes involved in establishing collective reality differ fundamentally from those involved in validating individual truth claims. The asymmetrical structure operates as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Reality Construction</strong>: Multiple individual subjective verifications aggregate over time into a collective concept of “reality.” This is not a democratic vote but a complex process where successful verification practices, institutional authentication, and practical consequences combine to establish shared standards. Most of the times we’re not even aware that we buid what we call reality.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2: Truth Validation</strong>: New individual truth claims are validated not against personal experience alone but against this established collective reality. When I claim that George Washington was the first U.S. president, I validate this not through personal historical experience but through appeal to the collective construct that includes documentary evidence, institutional authentication, and scholarly consensus.</p>
<p>This asymmetry avoids circularity because the collective reality is not the same thing as the personal reality. The collective reality emerges from past successful verifications; it then serves as a standard for present verification. The process resembles scientific methodology: individual experiments (subjective verifications) contribute to theoretical frameworks (collective reality), which then guide the interpretation of new experimental results (individual truth claims).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn5"><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;This asymmetrical validation process appears to be novel in the epistemological literature. While coherentist theories (developed by philosophers like <a href="#ref-lehrer1990">Lehrer 1990</a>; <a href="#ref-bonjour1985">BonJour 1985</a>) examine circular justification, and foundationalist approaches seek bedrock certainties, the temporal asymmetry proposed here seems to offer a different solution to the regress problem that maintains both social construction and objective constraint.</p></div></div><p>This asymmetrical process preserves the essential link between truth and individual experience while explaining how personal verification gains collective authority. The model avoids two traditional pitfalls: the circular reasoning that plagues coherentist theories, where beliefs merely support each other without external grounding, and the isolation problem faced by strict foundationalist accounts, where individual certainty struggles to translate into shared knowledge. Instead, the asymmetrical model maintains that subjective experience provides the primary epistemic foundation, while collective validation mechanisms transform these individual insights into socially authoritative truths.</p>
</section>
<section id="reality-as-collective-conscious-archetype" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reality-as-collective-conscious-archetype">Reality as Collective Conscious Archetype</h2>
<p>To understand how this asymmetrical process operates, we must examine the nature of the collective reality that emerges from aggregated verifications. This collective reality—not truth itself—functions as what I term a <strong>collective conscious archetype</strong>. While truth operates as the linguistic tool through which individuals contribute to and validate against this archetype, it is reality that serves as the shared structural pattern guiding our collective understanding.</p>
<p>The concept of conscious versus unconscious archetypes requires careful delineation. Operating with a definition where consciousness encompasses whatever enters the field of awareness and becomes available for rational determination, we can distinguish between collective patterns that operate below the threshold of recognition and those that remain accessible to conscious engagement.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;<strong>Unconscious collective archetypes</strong>—such as the Anima, the Hero, or the Self—operate as structural patterns that create&nbsp;<strong>force field-like influences</strong>&nbsp;on individual behavior without conscious recognition of their archetypal source. Individuals experience the pull of these forces—the quest for wholeness, the call to adventure, the attraction to completion through relationship—while believing their responses emerge from personal desires or circumstances rather than participation in trans-personal structural influences.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn6"><p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp;This distinction between conscious and unconscious archetypes builds on (<a href="#ref-jung1959">Jung 1959</a>). However, the application to epistemological problems and the conscious/unconscious distinction in collective validation processes appears to be novel.</p></div></div><p>What I call <strong>Conscious collective archetypes</strong>, by contrast, maintain the same&nbsp;<strong>force field quality</strong>&nbsp;that orients behavior while preserving individual freedom, but operate within the field of conscious awareness where they can be rationally engaged. The concept of “Truth” is our main interaction tool in relation with this conscious archetypal structure of reality. When we appeal to truth standards, we experience the orienting force of truth-seeking—the compulsion to verify, to seek evidence, to test claims—but what we’re actually doing is measuring individual claims against the collective reality-archetype. We say “Is it true?” rather than “Do I believe it?” precisely because we consciously acknowledge that we’re testing claims against a trans-personal reality construct rather than following purely personal judgment.</p>
<p>This conscious engagement preserves&nbsp;<strong>rational agency</strong>&nbsp;precisely because we recognize the archetypal force we’re participating in. Unlike unconscious archetypes that influence through unrecognized participation, reality as a conscious archetype allows us to interrogate the verification patterns themselves, propose modifications to validation methods, and consciously resist collective truth claims while remaining within the archetypal field. As James would put it, truth has enormous personal value for us, so that we’re guided by it and search it personally at first and as a collective most of our life. We can consciously participate in peer review, debate editorial standards, challenge authority claims, and advocate for methodological reforms. The conscious nature of the reality-archetype, accessed through truth-claims, explains how our concept of reality can evolve through deliberate critique rather than unconscious drift.</p>
<p>The archetypal structure also explains the persistence and power of truth-validation practices across different contexts. Like any archetype, reality as a collective pattern manifests through specific truth-seeking methods—scientific experiments, legal proceedings, journalistic investigations—while maintaining <strong>structural consistency</strong> across these diverse applications. The reality-archetype provides the underlying <strong>organizing pattern</strong> that makes these different truth-seeking practices recognizably similar despite their contextual differences, because they all aim to access and contribute to the same collective reality.</p>
<p>Importantly, this collective conscious archetype represents an&nbsp;<strong>emergent property</strong>&nbsp;of human language and culture rather than a natural given found by experience in nature. The archetype emerges from the practical necessities of social coordination and knowledge transmission, but once established, it operates as a relatively autonomous framework that constrains and enables individual truth claims. This emergence explains why reality feels both socially constructed and objectively binding—it is collectively created but operates with structural authority that transcends individual preference.</p>
</section>
<section id="language-as-validation-medium" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="language-as-validation-medium">5. Language as Validation Medium</h2>
<p>James observes that “all human thinking gets discursified; we exchange ideas; we lend and borrow verifications, get them from one another by means of social intercourse.” This discursive character reveals how truth emerges specifically in social contexts where experience must be validated against collective standards.</p>
<p>Consider the difference between “It’s raining” (direct experience report) and “Is it true that it’s raining in Ukraine?” (truth-validation request). The second formulation explicitly invokes collective validation standards that transcend individual experience. I rarely tell myself “It is true it is raining”—truth loses value when direct verification is possible. Truth-language emerges precisely when we must rely on the collective conscious archetype for validation.</p>
<p>This linguistic mediation explains why truth functions as a quality of language rather than of the world directly. The world contains rain, electrons, and historical events; language contains true statements about these phenomena. Unlike unconscious archetypes that operate below reflective awareness, the linguistic constitution of reality enables communities to explicitly debate and modify their validation criteria—to consciously reshape how truth functions.</p>
<p>The archetypal transformations is more visible in scientific revolutions. When Newton mathematized physics or Darwin legitimized historical explanation, they weren’t just adding new truths—they were transforming the collective representation of reality itself. Quantum mechanics didn’t merely introduce probabilistic predictions; it changed our archetypal understanding from “truth requires deterministic predictability” to “truth requires optimal predictive accuracy given fundamental limitations.” What Kuhn calls “paradigm shift” represents a conscious reformation of the reality archetype, affecting how truth functions across all domains.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="truth-validation-institutions-the-concrete-mechanisms-of-collective-verification">Truth-Validation Institutions: The Concrete Mechanisms of Collective Verification</h2>
<p>The abstract archetypal structure of reality is built at the concrete level through&nbsp;<strong>truth-validation institutions</strong>—specific social mechanisms that implement and evolve collective verification standards. These institutions provide the practical means through which the asymmetrical validation process functions and the conscious archetype maintains both stability and adaptability.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn7"><p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;The concept of truth-validation institutions can be found also on (<a href="#ref-berger-luckmann1966">Berger and Luckmann 1966</a>), but focuses specifically on epistemic institutions. It also draws from science studies work on epistemic communities (<a href="#ref-knorr-cetina1999">Knorr-Cetina 1999</a>), the sociology of scientific knowledge (<a href="#ref-bloor1976">Bloor 1976</a>; <a href="#ref-barnes1977">Barnes 1977</a>), and philosophers of science like (<a href="#ref-longino1990">Longino 1990</a>) who examine the social organization of inquiry. However, this is not the place to engage them and are mentioned only for further research.</p></div></div><p>Truth-validation institutions have evolved dramatically across historical periods, reflecting changes in information technology, social organization, and epistemic needs. In what we might call the&nbsp;<strong>Traditional Era</strong>, libraries, universities, and scholarly guilds functioned as knowledge gatekeepers, determining what counted as authoritative knowledge through hierarchical validation systems. These institutions operated through personal authority and manuscript transmission, limiting access to verification processes while maintaining quality control through expert curation.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Internet Era</strong>&nbsp;introduced algorithmic validation mechanisms, most notably Google’s PageRank algorithm, which uses “links pointing to” as a proxy for collective validation. This represents a shift from hierarchical to network-based truth validation, where authority emerges from the aggregate linking behavior of web communities rather than expert institutional gatekeepers. The algorithmic approach democratizes access to validation processes while introducing new challenges around manipulation and quality control.</p>
<p>The emerging&nbsp;<strong>LLM Era</strong>&nbsp;suggests yet another transformation toward direct interface with what might be called “metamorphic knowledge”—collectively validated information that shapes itself in response to individual queries based on LLM’s patterns of the entire linguistic records of what communities have accepted as true, either informally or formally. This represents a move toward synchronous rather than asynchronous validation, where truth standards become immediately responsive to individual inquiry. This shift it is a catalyst for a profound change in how we understand the nature of truth, that is a search for a new collective representation of truth archetype which, at first, took the radical look of “post-truth theories”. But we should not be misled by this radical and finally flawed view of these new theories only because they just announce a collective realization: reality is a construct. Because this is not the type of construct one can take over for his own purposes.</p>
<p>These institutions also embody the conscious archetypal structure by maintaining&nbsp;<strong>transparency and revisability</strong>&nbsp;in their validation processes. Unlike unconscious social patterns, truth-validation institutions typically include explicit procedures for challenge, appeal, and methodological modification. Scientific journals publish methodology sections; legal systems include appellate procedures; journalistic organizations maintain editorial standards that can be publicly scrutinized and challenged. And from time to time, dramatic change in norms, methods and procedures of validation in all these domains, appears.</p>
<p>These ideas can all be summed up in a short sentence: Language is the infrastructure of Reality and Truth, its builder.</p>

<h1>Theoretical Distinctions: Beyond Social Constructivism and Relativism</h1>
<p>This framework of truth as collective conscious archetype requires distinction from superficially similar philosophical positions.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Social Constructivism</strong>: While engaging with Berger and Luckmann’s analysis of socially constructed reality, this framework maintains crucial <strong>objective grounding</strong> that strong constructivism abandons.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Truth-validation institutions remain constrained by successful verification practices rather than operating as purely conventional constructions. The asymmetrical validation process anchors collective standards to empirical success, not arbitrary cultural preference.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn8"><p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;(<a href="#ref-berger-luckmann1966">Berger and Luckmann 1966</a>) provides a foundational analysis of how social reality is constructed through processes of institutionalization, legitimation, and socialization. Their work examines how “knowledge” becomes socially constructed through the dialectical process where “Society is a human product. Society is an objective reality. Man is a social product.” The present framework builds on their insight that social institutions play a crucial role in constructing reality, but differs in two key ways: first, by distinguishing between conscious and unconscious collective patterns (their analysis doesn’t employ archetypal distinctions), and second, by maintaining that truth-validation institutions remain constrained by empirical success rather than being purely conventional constructions. While Berger and Luckmann focus on how all reality becomes socially constructed, this framework argues that truth as a collective conscious archetype maintains objective grounding through its asymmetrical validation process.</p></div></div><p>Crucially, the conscious archetypal structure preserves <strong>rational agency</strong>. Because truth operates by explicitly validating what enters in the conscious archetype of reality, individuals can deliberately challenge and improve collective validation standards through reasoned argument and empirical demonstration—explaining how scientific progress remains possible within socially mediated frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Externalist Knowledge Production</strong>: The framework specifies mechanisms that pure externalism leaves vague. Truth-validation institutions aggregate individual experience into collective standards that authorize knowledge claims, embodying accumulated wisdom about successful verification. This explains how external validation maintains normative authority rather than collapsing into mere social description—individuals ought to respect institutional standards because of their demonstrated pragmatic superiority.</p>
<p>The relationship between individual truths and collective reality resembles a magnetic field: individual truths align like atoms to create the field (the reality archetype), while that same field orients new truth claims entering its influence. This explains how external validation maintains normative authority rather than collapsing into mere social description—the archetypal field both emerges from and shapes individual contributions. Unlike externalism’s vague “external standards,” this model shows precisely how collective and individual levels interact.</p>
<p><strong>Pragmatist Heritage and Relativism</strong>: Building on James’s insights while addressing classical pragmatism’s limitations, the framework extends pragmatic validation to collective institutional processes.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Truth has “cash value” at the social level through coordination benefits and collective problem-solving capacity.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn9"><p><sup>9</sup>&nbsp;The pragmatist tradition includes (<a href="#ref-peirce1878">Peirce 1878</a>), (<a href="#ref-james1907">James 1975</a>), and (<a href="#ref-dewey1920">Dewey 1920</a>). Contemporary neo-pragmatists like (<a href="#ref-rorty1979">Rorty 1979</a>) and (<a href="#ref-putnam1981">Putnam 1981</a>) have further developed pragmatist themes, though often in directions that abandon realist aspirations that this framework seeks to preserve.</p></div></div><p>The framework avoids relativistic collapse by maintaining the <em>revisability</em> of truth standards through rational challenge. While reality is collectively constructed, these standards emerge from practical verification success rather than arbitrary choice. In this sense The Reality Conscious Archetype is half emergent property, beyond individuals possibility to influence it, half social construct, because the same individuals build it.</p>

<section id="conclusion-truth-in-the-age-of-epistemic-crisis" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Conclusion: Truth in the Age of Epistemic Crisis</h1>
<p>This framework reveals how human communities construct their shared reality through the mechanism of truth. By understanding reality as a collective conscious archetype that we build and access through truth-claims, we illuminate both the social construction and objective constraint of human knowledge.</p>
<p>The insight transforms how we understand epistemic crises. “Post-truth” discourse misses the deeper issue: we’re not abandoning truth but witnessing conflicts over which truth-validation institutions will shape our collective reality-archetype. When algorithmic validation competes with peer review, when alternative media creates parallel epistemic communities, the struggle concerns which truth-building processes will construct tomorrow’s shared reality.</p>
<p>Three critical implications emerge:</p>
<p>First, <strong>institutional design becomes reality construction</strong>. As AI systems emerge as new truth-validation mechanisms, we must ensure they strengthen rather than erode the asymmetrical process that grounds our collective reality in verified experience. The tools we use to establish truth literally shape the reality future generations will inhabit and we are at risk to forget that, as James says, ultimately every truth was directly verified by someone.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn10"><p><sup>10</sup>&nbsp;One can place here the difficult relationship that LLMs have with the truth. Truth is not an internal feature to language, it’s the device bridging language and reality, in both its personal and collective flavors. A LLM can verify, at most, that some text is what is claimed to be, but that is about all.</p></div></div><p>Second, <strong>epistemic literacy means understanding truth as a building tool</strong>. Citizens need to grasp how truth-claims construct collective reality—not as passive inhabitants of a pre-given world but as conscious participants in reality’s ongoing construction through their truth-seeking practices.</p>
<p>Third, <strong>the conscious nature of our reality-archetype enables hope</strong>. Unlike unconscious patterns that trap communities in destructive cycles, our collective reality remains open to deliberate reconstruction through improved truth-validation methods. Scientific revolutions demonstrate this: when truth-building tools evolve, reality itself transforms.</p>
<p>James’s pragmatic insight points toward truth’s profound role: not merely describing an independent reality but actively constructing the collective conscious archetype within which human knowledge becomes possible. Understanding truth as reality’s builder—rather than its mere reporter—provides the conceptual tools needed to strengthen our epistemic institutions precisely when they matter most.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgment of Scope and Time Limitations</h1>
<p>Space and time constraints prevented not only deeper investigation of connected inter-disciplinary subjects but also engagement with foundational works by Foucault, Wittgenstein, and Habermas, whose insights on power, language, and rationality could deepen this analysis. They are mentioned here to acknowledge their future role in any in-depth research on the matter. It is my intention to turn this essay into a proper paper somewhere in the future.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-note-on-bibliography">A note on Bibliography</h2>
<p>In a proper paper such a long and diverse Bibliography may look suspicious. I do believe in fewer references more deeply integrated. However, at this stage I feel a need to write down all the relevant connections I found just as an aide-memoire to further work. It is not, in any way, an attempt to impress the reader of this text.</p>
