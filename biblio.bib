  abstract = {In contemporary theories of the structure of matter at very short distance scales, various properties (some of them hypothetical as yet) of the vacuum are of crucial importance. The technical framework for such studies is quantum field theory. The aim of this article is to provide access, for a nonspecialist readership, to the physics of the vacuum as presently understood in quantum field theory. To do this, heavy reliance is placed on a fundamental analogy. The basic theoretical entity-the quantum field-is here regarded as analogous to a quantum-mechanical system with (infinitely)many degrees of freedom. A system of interacting quantum fields is then analogous to a complicated system in solid state physics; it can exist in different energy states, namely the ground state and various excited states. The excited states of the field system are characterized by the presence of excitation quanta, which are the particles (electrons,quarks, photons.. .) of which our material world is composed. In the ground state of the field system there are no excitation quanta, and hence no particles, present: the vacuum is this ground state. Consequently, different features of the vacuum may be modelled by the ground states of various appropriate solid state systems.For example, the vibrational ground state of a crystal models the electromagnetic field vacuum, a semiconductor models the Dirac vacuum, and superconductors may model aspects of the vacuum as regards the strong and weak forces.These and other models are used in qualitative discussions of many phenomena which involve the properties and structure of the vacuum: for example, spontaneous emission and the Lamb shift, pair creation and the associated screening of charge by vacuum polarization, the origin of mass for the W and Z bosons, and the confinement of quarks. Finally, several of the themes are gathered together in a brief introduction to the hypothesis that the universe itself is the grossly inflated result of a vacuum fluctuation.},

  abstract = {The philosophy of language, which has historically been developed through an anthropocentric lens, is now being forced to move towards post-anthropocentrism due to the advent of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), which are considered to possess linguistic abilities comparable to those of humans. Traditionally, LLMs have been explained through distributional semantics as their foundational semantics. However, recent research is exploring alternative foundational semantics beyond distributional semantics. This paper proposes Robert Brandom's inferentialist semantics as an suitable foundational semantics for LLMs, specifically focusing on the issue of linguistic representationalism within this post-anthropocentric trend. Here, we show that the anti-representationalism and logical expressivism of inferential semantics, as well as quasi-compositionality, are useful in interpreting the characteristics and behaviors of LLMs. Further, we propose a \textbackslash emph\textbraceleft consensus theory of truths\textbraceright{} for LLMs. This paper argues that the characteristics of LLMs challenge mainstream assumptions in philosophy of language, such as semantic externalism and compositionality. We believe the argument in this paper leads to a re-evaluation of anti\textbackslash hyphen\textbraceleft\textbraceright representationalist views of language, potentially leading to new developments in the philosophy of language.},

For a theory to have a certain symmetry is for the theory to stipulate that models related by the symmetry represent the same possibility. I show that the stipulational account compares positively with alternatives, including Dasgupta's epistemic account of symmetry, M ller-Nielsen's motivational account, and so-called formal and ontic accounts. In particular, the stipulational account avoids the problems Belot and Dasgupta have raised against formal and ontic accounts of symmetry while retaining many of the advantages of these otherwise-attractive frameworks.},

  abstract = {Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena, and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e. either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define new appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate for the first time the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

  abstract = {This book explores the role of causal constraints in science, shifting our attention from causal relations between individual events--the focus of most philosophical treatments of causation--to a broad family of concepts and principles generating constraints on possible change. Yemima Ben-Menahem looks at determinism, locality, stability, symmetry principles, conservation laws, and the principle of least action-causal constraints that serve to distinguish events and processes that our best scientific theories mandate or allow from those they rule out. Ben-Menahem's approach reveals that causation is just as relevant to explaining why certain events fail to occur as it is to explaining events that do occur. She investigates the conceptual differences between, and interrelations of, members of the causal family, thereby clarifying problems at the heart of the philosophy of science. Ben-Menahem argues that the distinction between determinism and stability is pertinent to the philosophy of history and the foundations of statistical mechanics, and that the interplay of determinism and locality is crucial for understanding quantum mechanics. Providing historical perspective, she traces the causal constraints of contemporary science to traditional intuitions about causation, and demonstrates how the teleological appearance of some constraints is explained away in current scientific theories such as quantum mechanics},

In this position paper, we argue that a system trained only on form has a priori no way to learn meaning. In keeping with the ACL 2020 theme of ``Taking Stock of Where We've Been and Where We're Going'', we argue that a clear understanding of the distinction between form and meaning will help guide the field towards better science around natural language understanding.}

BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

  abstract = {Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell,  (18 May 1872 -- 2 February 1970) was a British mathematician, logician, philosopher, and public intellectual. He had influence on mathematics, logic, set theory, and various areas of analytic philosophy. He was one of the early 20th century's prominent logicians and a founder of analytic philosophy, along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege, his friend and colleague G. E. Moore, and his student and prot\'eg\'e Ludwig Wittgenstein. Russell with Moore led the British "revolt against idealism". Together with his former teacher A. N. Whitehead, Russell wrote Principia Mathematica, a milestone in the development of classical logic and a major attempt to reduce the whole of mathematics to logic (see Logicism). Russell's article "On Denoting" has been considered a "paradigm of philosophy". Russell was a pacifist who championed anti-imperialism and chaired the India League.  He went to prison for his pacifism during World War I, and initially supported appeasement against Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, before changing his view in 1943, describing war as a necessary "lesser of two evils". In the wake of World War II, he welcomed American global hegemony in favour of either Soviet hegemony or no (or ineffective) world leadership, even if it were to come at the cost of using their nuclear weapons. He would later criticise Stalinist totalitarianism, condemn the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War, and become an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament. In 1950, Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature "in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought". He was also the recipient of the De Morgan Medal (1932), Sylvester Medal (1934), Kalinga Prize (1957), and Jerusalem Prize (1963).},

  abstract = {F. H. Bradley (1846--1924) was the most famous, original andphilosophically influential of the British Idealists. Thesephilosophers came to prominence in the closing decades of thenineteenth century, but their effect on British philosophy and societyat large --- and, through the positions of power attained by someof their pupils in the institutions of the British Empire, on much ofthe world --- persisted well into the first half of the twentieth.They stood out amongst their peers in consciously rejecting some mainaspects of the tradition of their earlier compatriots, such as Humeand Mill, and responding, albeit in an original and critical fashion,rather to the work of Kant and Hegel., But it would involve a significant degree of distortion to depict theBritish Idealists as simply choosing Hegel over Hume, as thedenomination `Neo-Hegelians' all too easily suggests. Onthe contrary, they were open to a variety of influences, including thephilosophy of an anti-idealist thinker such as J.F. Herbart and of thesubsequently forgotten but then prominent Hermann Lotze, anindependent mind whose speculations are difficult to classify in termsof the idealist/realist opposition. Upon the whole, the Idealistsrevitalized British philosophy by making it permeable to a richvariety of continental ideas. In this way, they helped prepare theground on which analytic philosophy would eventually flourish, as mostIdealists were very well acquainted with the works of Frege'scontemporaries (e.g. Sigwart) and discussed their ideas in theirlogical treatises. Bradley was a leading figure in this movement oforiginal reappropriation of alien ideas, which he explicitly promotedas the sole antidote to dogmatism and intellectual sclerosis in the`Preface' to Appearance and Reality. `Thepresent generation', he said, `is learning that to gaineducation a man must study in more than one school' (p.viii)., It is for his metaphysics that Bradley has become best known. Heargued that our everyday conceptions of the world (as well as thosemore refined ones common among his philosophical predecessors) containhidden contradictions which appear, fatally, when we try to think outtheir consequences. In particular, Bradley rejected on these groundsthe view that reality can be understood as consisting of many objectsexisting independently of each other (pluralism) and of our experienceof them (realism). Consistently, his own view combined substancemonism --- the claim that reality is one, that there are no realseparate things --- with metaphysical idealism --- the claimthat reality consists solely of idea or experience. This vision of theworld had a profound effect on the verse of T.S. Eliot, who studiedphilosophy at Harvard and wrote a Ph.D. thesis on Bradley., On later generations of philosophers, however, Bradley'scontributions to moral philosophy and the philosophy of logic were farmore influential than his metaphysics. His critical examination ofhedonism --- the view that the goal of morality is themaximization of general pleasure --- was seminal and stands as apermanent contribution to the subject which can still be read withprofit today. Some of the doctrines of his logic have become standardand unnoticed assumptions through their acceptance by BertrandRussell, an acceptance which survived Russell's subsequentrepudiation of idealist logic and metaphysics., Other notable figures among the British Idealists were BernardBosanquet, Edward Caird, T.H. Green, Harold Joachim and J.M.E.McTaggart.},

  abstract = {This work defends the 'Whole Hog Thesis': sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are full-blown linguistic and cognitive agents, possessing understanding, beliefs, desires, knowledge, and intentions. We argue against prevailing methodologies in AI philosophy, rejecting starting points based on low-level computational details ('Just an X' fallacy) or pre-existing theories of mind. Instead, we advocate starting with simple, high-level observations of LLM behavior (e.g., answering questions, making suggestions) -- defending this data against charges of metaphor, loose talk, or pretense. From these observations, we employ 'Holistic Network Assumptions' -- plausible connections between mental capacities (e.g., answering implies knowledge, knowledge implies belief, action implies intention) -- to argue for the full suite of cognitive states. We systematically rebut objections based on LLM failures (hallucinations, planning/reasoning errors), arguing these don't preclude agency, often mirroring human fallibility. We address numerous 'Games of Lacks', arguing that LLMs do not lack purported necessary conditions for cognition (e.g., semantic grounding, embodiment, justification, intrinsic intentionality) or that these conditions are not truly necessary, often relying on anti-discriminatory arguments comparing LLMs to diverse human capacities. Our approach is evidential, not functionalist, and deliberately excludes consciousness. We conclude by speculating on the possibility of LLMs possessing 'alien' contents beyond human conceptual schemes.},

The intense debate that followed Donnellan's paper focused on the contrast between Donnellan and Russell, leaving Strawson aside. In this paper, I focus on the contrast between Donnellan and Strawson. By focusing on this contrast, my aim is, first, to clarify the nature of Donnellan's distinction between referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions and, second, to argue that a proper understanding of referential uses holds the key to a proper understanding of direct reference. Contrary to the standard view, the crucial issue is not the nature of the proposition expressed (singular versus general) but how a speaker comes to talk about an object.},

  abstract = {Nancy Cartwright argues for a novel conception of the role of fundamental scientific laws in modern natural science. If we attend closely to the manner in which theoretical laws figure in the practice of science, we see that despite their great explanatory power these laws do not describe reality. Instead, fundamental laws describe highly idealized objects in models. Thus, the correct account of explanation in science is not the traditional covering law view, but the 'simulacrum' account. On this view, explanation is a matter of constructing a model that may employ, but need not be consistent with, a theoretical framework, in which phenomenological laws that are true of the empirical case in question can be derived. Anti-realism about theoretical laws does not, however, commit one to anti-realism about theoretical entities. Belief in theoretical entities can be grounded in well-tested localized causal claims about concrete physical processes, sometimes now called 'entity realism'. Such causal claims provide the basis for partial realism and they are ineliminable from the practice of explanation and intervention in nature.},

We run a study assessing nonexperts' ability to distinguish between humanand machine-authored text (GPT2 and GPT3) in three domains (stories, news articles, and recipes). We find that, without training, evaluators distinguished between GPT3- and humanauthored text at random chance level. We explore three approaches for quickly training evaluators to better identify GPT3-authored text (detailed instructions, annotated examples, and paired examples) and find that while evaluators' accuracy improved up to 55\%, it did not significantly improve across the three domains. Given the inconsistent results across text domains and the often contradictory reasons evaluators gave for their judgments, we examine the role untrained human evaluations play in NLG evaluation and provide recommendations to NLG researchers for improving human evaluations of text generated from state-of-the-art models.},

I am accutely aware that some of the ideas diverge widely from the tradition but it is my conviction that inter-disciplinarity is the only way to recapture the whole meaning of the sacred texts.},

This volume presents thirteen recent essays that together provide a systematic account of the relation between meaningful experience (intentionality) and responsiveness to norms. They argue for a new understanding of the philosophical importance of phenomenology, taking the work of Husserl and Heidegger as exemplary, and introducing a conception of phenomenology broad enough to encompass the practices of both philosophers. Crowell discusses Husserl's analyses of first-person authority, the semantics of conscious experience, the structure of perceptual content, and the embodied subject, and shows how Heidegger's interpretation of the self addresses problems in Husserl's approach to the normative structure of meaning. His volume will be valuable for upper-level students and scholars interested in phenomenological approaches to philosophical questions in both the European and the analytic traditions.},

  abstract = {"Reading Wittgenstein with Anscombe, Going On To Ethics is a collection of seven essays, divided into three parts. The essays bring out connections between Wittgenstein's thinking and questions of continuing interest in the philosophy of language, logic, and ethics.

  abstract = {Consider reading the news about the recent election, taking part in a classroom discussion about injustice, or having a conversation about dinner, with your friend. In these cases, you rely on your capacity for linguistic understanding. How do we come to understand what other people communicate to us on particular occasions? In recent philosophical debates about this question, we find two broad approaches: the perceptual approach, which claims that we come to understand an utterance by employing broadly perceptual capacities to perceive or quasi-perceive the utterance's meaning; and the inferential approach, which claims that we come to understand an utterance by employing broadly inferential capacities to infer what is being conveyed by an utterance. This paper focuses on the debates concerning these two approaches. We provide conceptual and methodological clarifications regarding linguistic understanding and introduce some of the key philosophical debates concerning its nature, including those concerning its phenomenology and underlying psychology, with a focus on the role of perception and inference. We also discuss some epistemological questions concerning the understanding of linguistic utterances and different views that try to explain its epistemological role(s). This paper is an introduction to the special issue `Linguistic Understanding: Perception and Inference'.},

  abstract = {In this paper I present and assess, firstly independently from one another, and then comparatively, the strengths and the weaknesses of three views on semantics: model-theoretic, truth-conditional, and proof-theoretic. The whole philosophical perspective from which I explore these three approaches is motivated by the investigation of the connection between truth and meaning, as well as by the understanding of the role and place of meaning within a physicalist outlook of the world. I also hint at how one can combine and coordinate the three approaches depending on the philosophical issues which those systems seek to model. In the process, I present the philosophical rich and nuanced positions of Donald Davidson who pioneered the Tarski-type truth-conditional semantics for natural languages, and of Wilfrid Sellars who made an essential contribution to the understanding of both semantic and pragmatic aspects of the relations between truth and meaning from an inferentialist (proof) based perspective. I offer a sketch of how certain problems within the Davidsonian framework can be fixed by using the Sellarsian framework. The paper ends with some critical points and challenges that I raise against the proof-theoretic (inferentialist) approach questioning its power to give a complete account of the issue concerning the relationship between truth, meanings, and rules.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This book explores the idea that we have two minds -- one being automatic, unconscious, and fast, the other controlled, conscious, and slow. In recent years, there has been great interest in so-called dual-process theories of reasoning and rationality. According to such theories, there are two distinct systems underlying human reasoning: an evolutionarily old system that is associative, automatic, unconscious, parallel, and fast; and a more recent, distinctively human system which is rule-based, controlled, conscious, serial, and slow. Within the former, processes are held to be innate and to use heuristics that evolved to solve specific adaptive problems. In the latter, processes are taken to be learned, flexible, and responsive to rational norms. Despite the attention these theories are attracting, there is still poor communication between dual-process theorists themselves, and the substantial bodies of work on dual processes in cognitive psychology and social psychology remain isolated from each other. The book brings together researchers on dual processes to summarize the latest research, highlight key issues, present different perspectives, explore implications, and provide a stimulus to further work. It includes new ideas about the human mind both by contemporary philosophers interested in broad theoretical questions about mental architecture, and by psychologists specializing in traditionally distinct and isolated fields.},

  abstract = {Natural language is inherently a discrete symbolic representation of human knowledge. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and in natural language processing (NLP) seem to contradict the above intuition: discrete symbols are fading away, erased by vectors or tensors called distributed and distributional representations. However, there is a strict link between distributed/distributional representations and discrete symbols, being the first an approximation of the second. A clearer understanding of the strict link between distributed/distributional representations and symbols may certainly lead to radically new deep learning networks. In this paper we make a survey that aims to renew the link between symbolic representations and distributed/distributional representations. This is the right time to revitalize the area of interpreting how discrete symbols are represented inside neural networks.},

Hartry Field argues that we can explain the utility of mathematics without assuming it true. Part of the argument is that good mathematics has a special feature ('conservativeness') that allows it to be applied to 'nominalistic' claims (roughly, those neutral to the existence of mathematical entities) in a way that generates nominalistic consequences more easily without generating any new ones. Field goes on to argue that we can axiomatize physical theories using nominalistic claims only, and that in fact this has advantages over the usual axiomatizations that are independent of nominalism. There has been much debate about the book since it first appeared. It is now reissued in a revised contains a substantial new preface giving the author's current views on the original book and the issues that were raised in the subsequent discussion of it."},

The first five are on the notions of truth and truth-conditions, and their role in a theory of meaning and of the content of our mental states. The next five deal with what I call `factually defective discourse'---discourse that gives rise to issues about which, it is tempting to say that, there is no fact of the matter as to the right answer; one particular kind of factually defective discourse is called `indeterminacy', and it gets the bulk of the attention. The final bunch of papers deal with issues about objectivity, closely related to issues about factual defectiveness; two deal with the question of whether the axioms of mathematics are as objective as is often assumed, and one deals with the question of whether our epistemological methods are as objective as they are usually assumed to be.},

The attempts to settle the boundaries of ``analytic philosophy'' as a self-consisting philosophy through its methods and objectives have, however, significant limitations. As a matter of fact, the term is used in order to refer to various ways of making philosophy which, despite of many differences, have all in common the clear-cut distinction from philosophical traditions such as phenomenology, hermeneutics or postmodern philosophy. In this way, one can distinguish various concepts of analytic philosophy, either restrictive or broad. Despite of this, some minimal conditions that characterize a kind of philosophy as analytic can be pointed out.},

Whereas interactionisin stresses the continuity of perceptual and cognitive processes, modularity theory argues for their distinctness. It is argued, in particular, that the apparent plausibility of New Look theorizing derives from the failure to distinguish between the (correct) claim that perceptual processes are inferential and the (dubious) claim that they arc unencapsulated', that is, that they arc arbitrarily sensitive to the organism's beliefs and desires. In fact, according to modularity theory, perceptual processes are computationally isolated from much of the background knowledge to which cognitive processes have access. The postulation of autonomous, domain-specific psychological mechanisms underlying perceptual integration connects modularity theory with the tradition of faculty psychology, in particular, with the work of Franz Joseph Call. Some ofthese historical affinities, and some of the relations between faculty psychology and Cartesianism, are discussed in the book.},

I will review some of the most common arguments in support of the instrumentalist view and I will suggest that a form of weak representation that does not imply ontological commitment can be applied to the diagrams. Such a form of weak representation will be characterized as non-denotative, intentional, and as conveying a physical interpretation through narrative explanations.},

Interpretations of these two sections of the Psalm are explored among a sample of 30 Anglican deacons and priests serving as curates who were invited to work in small hermeneutical communities, structured according to psychological type theory and designed to test the sensing, intuition, feeling and thinking (SIFT) approach to biblical hermeneutics and liturgical preaching. The findings from the hermeneutical communities demonstrated that the poetic power of part two was perceived quite differently by sensing types and by intuitive types. The judgement against God's enemies in part four was evaluated quite differently by feeling types and by thinking types. The implications of these different readings of sacred text are discussed in relation both to hermeneutical theory and to homiletic practice.},

  abstract = {What do the rules of logic say about the meanings of the symbols they govern? In this book, James W. Garson examines the inferential behaviour of logical connectives (such as 'and', 'or', 'not' and 'if then'), whose behaviour is defined by strict rules, and proves definitive results concerning exactly what those rules express about connective truth conditions. He explores the ways in which, depending on circumstances, a system of rules may provide no interpretation of a connective at all, or the interpretation we ordinarily expect for it, or an unfamiliar or novel interpretation. He also shows how the novel interpretations thus generated may be used to help analyse philosophical problems such as vagueness and the open future. His book will be valuable for graduates and specialists in logic, philosophy of logic, and philosophy of language},

Behaviorists have, however, countered by demonstrating many inaccuracies, misquotes, and basic errors couched in Chomsky's emotional language. The purpose of this paper is to show that both parties are right. Although much of Chomsky's criticisms miss the mark, one very basic point that Chomsky himself endlessly repeats is yet unresolved. This part of Chomsky's is called the dilemma argument and is shown to be a valid constructive critique that behaviorists would do well to address. Therefore, it is necessary to go in some detail into this criticism. It is about time to flesh out its basic structure in order to add clarity to its examination. It is however, not the purpose of this paper to answer this criticism but only to highlight it. This will be a determined attempt at clarity, never giving up even when wading through Chomsky's general emotional attitude - to say the least.},

More recently, the Frege-Russell definition ofnumber and Tarski's definition of truth have exercised aformative influence on a wide range of contemporary philosophicaldebates. In all these cases---and many others can becited---not only have particular definitions been debated; thenature of, and demands on, definitions have also been debated. Some ofthese debates can be settled by making requisite distinctions, fordefinitions are not all of one kind: definitions serve a variety offunctions, and their general character varies with function. Someother debates, however, are not so easily settled, as they involvecontentious philosophical ideas such as essence, concept, andmeaning.},

Alex Flournoy from the Colorado School of Mines held 29 lectures in 2018 covering this topic. His lectures were available on YouTube at the time this transcript has been assembled and may still be available today as ``Particle Physics (2018)'' in 29 separate videos. The first 16 lectures cover the theoretical side of the topic with the formal structure of the Standard Model, symmetries, gauge fields and the Higgs mechanism, and the remaining 13 lectures touch on the practical side with the computational aspects of decays and scattering amplitudes. A thorough basis of modern physics including Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics is required, but knowledge of Quantum Field Theory is not a prerequisite.},

Building on the advances of the Middle Ages, Kepler conceived, albeit in rudimentary form, the fundamental physical ideas of mass, ``inertia,'' and gravitational ``mutual attraction.'' These splendid concepts were later developed and carried forward into Newton's era by several 17th-century natural philosophers. Unlike his three planetary laws, Kepler's physics has long gone unappreciated by the scientific community. Nonetheless, it formed the conceptual foundation for much of classical dynamics.},

We report an almost ideal realization of that gedanken experiment with single photons allowing unambiguous which-way measurements. The choice between open and closed configurations, made by a quantum random number generator, is relativistically separated from the entry of the photon into the interferometer.},

So the readerwill not be surprised to learn that scholars consider this discussionto be central to Kant's so-called critical philosophy. Given Kant'sreputation for developing difficult, not to say obscure, philosophicalviews, it will also not surprise the reader to learn that there is noconsensus on how Kant's conception of space and time ought to becharacterized and explicated. So the goal of this entry is to bringsome clarity to Kant's views by situating them historically andphilosophically within the milieu of some central debates concerningspace and time in the early modern period, especially the rich centurybetween the first edition of Newton's Principia mathematica,which was first published in 1687, and the publication of the secondedition of the Critique of Pure Reason, which occurredexactly a hundred years later. The difficulty of comprehending Kant'sviews gives interpreters a reason to place a special emphasis oncontext---I will especially highlight Kant's reactions to his mostsignificant predecessors in this area, Leibniz and Newton. The focusthroughout will be on Kant's magnum opus, the Critique of PureReason. Following tradition, and to some extent Kant's own lead,the focus will also be on space and on our representation of space,although parallel points concerning time (and its representation) willsometimes be indicated.},

This paper instead discusses an unpredictable phenomenon that we refer to as emergent abilities of large language models. We consider an ability to be emergent if it is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models. Thus, emergent abilities cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models. The existence of such emergence raises the question of whether additional scaling could potentially further expand the range of capabilities of language models.},

Further, the changes at the journal are shown, with the help of previous work on the journals Mind and The Philosophical Review, to be part of a pattern involving generalist philosophy journals in Britain and America during the period 1925--69. The pattern is one in which journals controlled by analytic philosophers systematically promote a form of critical philosophy and marginalize rival approaches to philosophy. This pattern, it is argued, helps to explain the growing dominance of analytic philosophy during the twentieth century and allows characterizing this form of philosophy as, at least during 1925--69, a sectarian form of critical philosophy.},

Here's a summary: 1. **Probability Concepts**: The text discusses the evolution of our understanding of probability, highlighting how current philosophical controversies may misrepresent the concept. The essay aims to illuminate how probability terms have developed from basic beginnings to complex scientific and technical applications, integrating both philosophical insights and practical observations [1]. 2. **Analytic and Substantial Arguments**: The focus is on clarifying the unique characteristics of analytic arguments and contrasting them with substantial arguments. The essay intends to distinguish between these two categories of arguments and explore their importance relative to other key philosophical distinctions [2]. 3. **Terminology in Arguments**: There is a suggestion to replace terms like `deductively' and `necessarily' with `analytically' or `unequivocally' based on context, emphasizing the complexity required to address various forms of criticism in arguments. These detailed distinctions, though initially tedious, are framed as critical for understanding their philosophical significance [3]. 4. **Logical Theory and Mathematics**: The essay touches on logical theory, suggesting a motive to model logic as a mathematical system to leverage more powerful reasoning tools. This reflects an exploration of the potentials and limits of translating logical principles into a more formalized mathematical framework [4]. 5. **Influence of Analytic Philosophy**: Finally, the text discusses the influence of the analytic ideal of argument, showing divergence between logical theory formulated with this ideal in mind and practical argument criticism. The essay ultimately critiques how the adoption of the analytic ideal can shape philosophical disciplines, suggesting its impact might extend beyond what is philosophically relevant [5]. These excerpts collectively explore the themes of argumentation, clarity, and progress within the analytic tradition, discussing both its methodological strengths and potential drawbacks.},

The first claim involves first-order quantification, a generalization concerning what kinds of things there are. The second involves second-order quantification, a generalization concerning what there is for things to be. Or so it appears. Following W.V.O. Quine, many philosophers have endorsed a thesis of Ontological Collapse about second-order quantification. They maintain that ultimately, second-order quantification reduces to first-order quantification over sets or properties, and therefore also carries the latter's distinctive ontological commitments. In this revised version of his doctoral dissertation, awarded the Wolfgang-Stegm\"uller-Prize in 2012, Stephan Kr\"amer examines the major arguments for Ontological Collapse in detail and finds all of them wanting. Quantifications, he argues, fall into at least two irreducible kinds: those on what things there are, and those on what there is for things to be.},

This paper explores the analogy between LLM embedding spaces and quantum mechanics, positing that LLMs operate within a quantized semantic space where words and phrases behave as quantum states. To capture nuanced semantic interference effects, we extend the standard real-valued embedding space to the complex domain, drawing parallels to the double-slit experiment. We introduce a "semantic wave function" to formalize this quantum-derived representation and utilize potential landscapes, such as the double-well potential, to model semantic ambiguity. Furthermore, we propose a complex-valued similarity measure that incorporates both magnitude and phase information, enabling a more sensitive comparison of semantic representations. We develop a path integral formalism, based on a nonlinear Schr\textbackslash "odinger equation with a gauge field and Mexican hat potential, to model the dynamic evolution of LLM behavior. This interdisciplinary approach offers a new theoretical framework for understanding and potentially manipulating LLMs, with the goal of advancing both artificial and natural language understanding.},

  abstract = {By virtue of linguistic compositionality, few syntactic rules and a finite lexicon can generate an unbounded number of sentences. That is, language, though seemingly high-dimensional, can be explained using relatively few degrees of freedom. An open question is whether contemporary language models (LMs) reflect the intrinsic simplicity of language that is enabled by compositionality. We take a geometric view of this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimension (ID) of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' ID, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between nonlinear and linear dimensionality, showing they respectively encode semantic and superficial aspects of linguistic composition.},

  abstract = {The recordable cerebral activity (readiness-potential, RP) that precedes a freely voluntary, fully endogenous motor act was directly compared with the reportable time (W) for appearance of the subjective experience of 'wanting' or intending to act. The onset of cerebral activity clearly preceded by at least several hundred milliseconds the reported time of conscious intention to act. This relationship held even for those series (with 'type II' RPs) in which subjects reported that all of the 40 self-initiated movements in the series appeared 'spontaneously' and capriciously. Data were obtained in at least 6 different experimental sessions with each of 5 subjects. In series with type II RPs, onset of the main negative shift in each RP preceded the corresponding mean W value by an average of about 350 ms, and by a minimum of about 150 ms. In series with type I RPs, in which an experience of preplanning occurred in some of the 40 self-initiated acts, onset of RP preceded W by an average of about 800 ms (or by 500 ms, taking onset of RP at 90 per cent of its area). Reports of W time depended upon the subject's recall of the spatial 'clock-position' of a revolving spot at the time of his initial awareness of wanting or intending to move. Two different modes of recall produced similar values. Subjects distinguished awareness of wanting to move (W) from awareness of actually moving (M). W times were consistently and substantially negative to, in advance of, mean times reported for M and also those for S, the sensation elicited by a task-related skin stimulus delivered at irregular times that were unknown to the subject. It is concluded that cerebral initiation of a spontaneous, freely voluntary act can begin unconsciously, that is, before there is any (at least recallable) subjective awareness that a 'decision' to act has already been initiated cerebrally. This introduces certain constraints on the potentiality for conscious initiation and control of voluntary acts.},

  abstract = {The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static, data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.

We then introduce GPT-3, a third-generation, autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like texts, and use the previous distinction to analyse it. We expand the analysis to present three tests based on mathematical, semantic (that is, the Turing Test), and ethical questions and show that GPT-3 is not designed to pass any of them. This is a reminder that GPT-3 does not do what it is not supposed to do, and that any interpretation of GPT-3 as the beginning of the emergence of a general form of artificial intelligence is merely uninformed science fiction. We conclude by outlining some of the significant consequences of the industrialisation of automatic and cheap production of good, semantic artefacts.},

Part II, Theories of Meaning, surveys the competing theories of linguistic meaning and compares their various advantages and liabilities. Part III, Pragmatics and Speech Acts, introduces the basic concepts of linguistic pragmatics and includes a detailed discussion of the problem of indirect force. Part IV, The Expressive and the Figurative, examines various forms of expressive language and what "metaphorical meaning" is and how most listeners readily grasp it."--},

Jourdain (1879--1919) from the 1909 second edition, Mach discusses the formulation of one of science's most fundamental theories. He provides his interpretation of the principle of the conservation of energy, claiming its foundations are not in mechanical physics. Mach's 1868 work on the definition of mass - one of his most significant contributions to mechanics - has been incorporated here. His perspective on the topic as a whole remains relevant to those interested in the history of science and the theory of knowledge.

Previous editions have been praised for the remarkable clarity of Maudlin's descriptions of both Bell's theorem and his examination of the potential conflict between the theorem and relativity. The third edition of this text has been carefully updated to reflect significant developments, including a new chapter covering important recent work in the foundations of physics. Foremost among these is Roderich Tumiulka's explicit, relativistic theory that can reproduce the quantum mechanical violation of Bell's inequality. The "Free Will Theorem" of John Conway and Simon Kochen is also discussed, as is the status of locality in the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum theory. The book has also been updated to reflect recent results in information theory. The book introduces philosophers to the relevant physics and demonstrates how philosophical analysis can help to resolve some of the problems, and requires no technical background in Physics. All of the physics is presented from first principles, and as much as possible is presented pictorially"--Provided by publisher},

But then, because the history of temperature is not treated as a subject in its own right, modern associations inadvertently get read back into the historical record. This essay attempts to lay down an authoritative record not of what people in the past thought about what we call `temperature' but of what they thought about what they called `temperature' (or one of its cognates), from medieval times to today. It is found that invention of the thermometer had little impact on the concept of temperature. Much more significant were Fahrenheit's invention of a reliable instrument and William Thomson's effort to make a degree of temperature a unit of measure. Overlapping definitions of temperature then emerged in the late nineteenth century, and twentiethcentury scientific developments forced physicists to reconsider temperature's conceptual boundaries. It turns out that the concept of temperature has evolved through stages that correspond to four increasingly sophisticated types of measurement. Its maturity sheds light on the philosophy of conceptual change.},

  abstract = {Aristotle said that induction (epagǀgƝ) is a proceeding from particulars to a universal, and the definition has been conventional ever since. But there is an ambiguity here. Induction in the Scholastic and the (so-called) Humean tradition has presumed that Aristotle meant going from particular statements to universal statements. But the alternate view, namely that Aristotle meant going from particular things to universal ideas, prevailed all through antiquity and then again from the time of Francis Bacon until the mid-nineteenth century. Recent scholarship is so steeped in the first-mentioned tradition that we have virtually forgotten the other. In this essay McCaskey seeks to recover that alternate tradition, a tradition whose leading theoreticians were William Whewell, Francis Bacon, Socrates, and in fact Aristotle himself. The examination is both historical and philosophical. The first part of the essay fills out the history. The latter part examines the most mature of the philosophies in the Socratic tradition, specifically Bacon's and Whewell's. After tracing out this tradition, McCaskey shows how this alternate view of induction is indeed employed in science, as exemplified by several instances taken from actual scientific practice. In this manner, McCaskey proposes to us that the Humean problem of induction is merely an artifact of a bad conception of induction and that a return to the Socratic conception might be warranted.},

In fact, material theories of induction prevailed all through antiquity and from the Renaissance to the mid-1800s. Recovering these past systems would not only fill lacunae in Norton's own theory but would highlight areas where Norton has not freed himself from the straightjacket of formal induction as much as he might think.

Selon lui, la gu\'erison exhaustive en psychoth\'erapie implique le recouvrement d'une << attitude religieuse conforme \`a soi-m\^eme >>. Or, une telle attitude est toujours cons\'equente \`a une exp\'erience religieuse int\'erieure v\'ecue par l'individu. L'exp\'erience religieuse est pour Jung une exp\'erience de l'union des contraires de la psych\'e, que sont le conscient et l'inconscient. La voie qui achemine le patient ou la patiente vers cette exp\'erience est une pratique favorisant les rapports entre son conscient et son inconscient. L'efficacit\'e de cette pratique est r\'egie par la loi de l'\'enantiodromie, loi qui d\'ecrit l'effet d'un revirement d'une r\'ealit\'e unilat\'erale dans son contraire lorsque l'on pousse celle-ci jusqu'\`a sa limite. Ainsi, en assumant son contraire qu'est l'inconscient, et l'<< ombre >> que celui-ci abrite, l'individu s'approche de la lumi\`ere de la gu\'erison. C'est au sein de la noirceur du mal absolu que porte son ombre qu'il se rend disponible \`a l'exp\'erience du << sens >>.},

This has prompted ongoing disagreements about the extent to which we can meaningfully ascribe any kind of linguistic or cognitive competence to language models. Such questions have deep philosophical roots, echoing longstanding debates about the status of artificial neural networks as cognitive models. This article--the first part of two companion papers--serves both as a primer on language models for philosophers, and as an opinionated survey of their significance in relation to classic debates in the philosophy cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. We cover topics such as compositionality, language acquisition, semantic competence, grounding, world models, and the transmission of cultural knowledge. We argue that the success of language models challenges several long-held assumptions about artificial neural networks. However, we also highlight the need for further empirical investigation to better understand their internal mechanisms. This sets the stage for the companion paper (Part II), which turns to novel empirical methods for probing the inner workings of language models, and new philosophical questions prompted by their latest developments.},

Unlike humans, these models learn language exclusively from textual data, without direct interaction with the real world. Nevertheless, they can generate seemingly meaningful text about a wide range of topics. This impressive accomplishment has rekindled interest in the classical 'Symbol Grounding Problem,' which questioned whether the internal representations and outputs of classical symbolic AI systems could possess intrinsic meaning. Unlike these systems, modern LLMs are artificial neural networks that compute over vectors rather than symbols. However, an analogous problem arises for such systems, which we dub the Vector Grounding Problem. This paper has two primary objectives. First, we differentiate various ways in which internal representations can be grounded in biological or artificial systems, identifying five distinct notions discussed in the literature: referential, sensorimotor, relational, communicative, and epistemic grounding. Unfortunately, these notions of grounding are often conflated. We clarify the differences between them, and argue that referential grounding is the one that lies at the heart of the Vector Grounding Problem. Second, drawing on theories of representational content in philosophy and cognitive science, we propose that certain LLMs, particularly those fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), possess the necessary features to overcome the Vector Grounding Problem, as they stand in the requisite causal-historical relations to the world that underpin intrinsic meaning. We also argue that, perhaps unexpectedly, multimodality and embodiment are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for referential grounding in artificial systems.},

Recent studies of networks have, by and large, steered clear of such weighted networks, which are often perceived as being harder to analyze than their unweighted counterparts. Here we point out that weighted networks can in many cases be analyzed using a simple mapping from a weighted network to an unweighted multigraph, allowing us to apply standard techniques for unweighted graphs to weighted ones as well. We give a number of examples of the method, including an algorithm for detecting community structure in weighted networks and a new and simple proof of the max-flow/min-cut theorem.},

  abstract = {Many current neurophysiological, psychophysical, and psychological approaches to vision rest on the idea that when we see, the brain produces an internal representation of the world. The activation of this internal representation is assumed to give rise to the experience of seeing. The problem with this kind of approach is that it leaves unexplained how the existence of such a detailed internal representation might produce visual consciousness. An alternative proposal is made here. We propose that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations does not generate the experience of seeing. The outside world serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the governing laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different sensory modalities. Several lines of empirical evidence are brought forward in support of the theory, in particular: evidence from experiments in sensorimotor adaptation, visual ``filling in,'' visual stability despite eye movements, change blindness, sensory substitution, and color perception.},

  abstract = {The linear representation hypothesis is the informal idea that semantic concepts are encoded as linear directions in the representation spaces of large language models (LLMs). Previous work has shown how to make this notion precise for representing binary concepts that have natural contrasts (e.g., \textbraceleft male, female\textbraceright ) as directions in representation space. However, many natural concepts do not have natural contrasts (e.g., whether the output is about an animal). In this work, we show how to extend the formalization of the linear representation hypothesis to represent features (e.g., is\_animal) as vectors. This allows us to immediately formalize the representation of categorical concepts as polytopes in the representation space. Further, we use the formalization to prove a relationship between the hierarchical structure of concepts and the geometry of their representations. We validate these theoretical results on the Gemma and LLaMA-3 large language models, estimating representations for 900+ hierarchically related concepts using data from WordNet.},

  abstract = {In psychology and cognitive neuroscience, pattern recognition describes a cognitive process that matches information from a stimulus with information retrieved from memory.Pattern recognition occurs when information from the environment is received and entered into short-term memory, causing automatic activation of a specific content of long-term memory. An early example of this is learning the alphabet in order. When a carer repeats `A, B, C' multiple times to a child, utilizing the pattern recognition, the child says `C' after they hear `A, B' in order. Recognizing patterns allows us to predict and expect what is coming. The process of pattern recognition involves matching the information received with the information already stored in the brain. Making the connection between memories and information perceived is a step of pattern recognition called identification. Pattern recognition requires repetition of experience. Semantic memory, which is used implicitly and subconsciously, is the main type of memory involved with recognition.Pattern recognition is not only crucial to humans, but to other animals as well. Even koalas, who possess less-developed thinking abilities, use pattern recognition to find and consume eucalyptus leaves. The human brain has developed more, but holds similarities to the brains of birds and lower mammals. The development of neural networks in the outer layer of the brain in humans has allowed for better processing of visual and auditory patterns. Spatial positioning in the environment, remembering findings, and detecting hazards and resources to increase chances of survival are examples of the application of pattern recognition for humans and animals.There are six main theories of pattern recognition: template matching, prototype-matching, feature analysis, recognition-by-components theory, bottom-up and top-down processing, and Fourier analysis. The application of these theories in everyday life is not mutually exclusive. Pattern recognition allows us to read words, understand language, recognize friends, and even appreciate music. Each of the theories applies to various activities and domains where pattern recognition is observed. Facial, music and language recognition, and seriation are a few of such domains. Facial recognition and seriation occur through encoding visual patterns, while music and language recognition use the encoding of auditory patterns.},

While this progress holds extraordinary promise for various applications, it also raises profound philosophical questions about meaning, sentience and understanding within language games. This paper delves into the intricate relationship and interplay between AI, language and meaning. It explores some of the philosophical underpinnings of language, examining how AI systems can extract, translate and manipulate semantically sensible content. It also investigates a few of the challenges of developing AI systems with the ability to `understand' meaningful language that goes beyond surface semantic and syntactic proficiency, algorithmic intelligence and the probabilistic semantic route finding used by Large Language Models (LLMs) with their reliance on large data sets.},

  abstract = {The recent movement towards virtue-theoretic treatments of epistemological concepts can be understood in terms of the desire to eliminate epistemic luck. Significantly, however, it is argued that the two main varieties of virtue epistemology are responding to different types of epistemic luck. In particular, whilst proponents of reliabilism-based virtue theories have been focusing on the problem of what I call ``veritic'' epistemic luck, non-reliabilism-based virtue theories have instead been concerned with a very different type of epistemic luck, what I call ``reflective'' epistemic luck. It is argued that, prima facie at least, both forms of epistemic luck need to be responded to by any adequate epistemological theory. The problem, however, is that one can best eliminate veritic epistemic luck by adducing a so-called safety-based epistemological theory that need not be allied to a virtue-based account, and there is no fully adequate way of eliminating reflective epistemic luck. I thus conclude that this raises a fundamental difficulty for virtuebased epistemological theories, on either construal.},

Study 1 investigated whether 10-month-olds use both perceptual and social cues to learn a word. Study 2, a control study, tested whether infants paired the label with a particular spatial location rather than to an object. Results show that 10-month-olds can learn new labels and do so by relying on the perceptual salience of an object instead of social cues provided by a speaker. This is in direct contrast to the way in which older children (12-, 18-, and 24-month-olds) learn and extend new object names.},

  abstract = {In 1922 Skolem delivered an address before the Fifth Congress of Scandinavian Mathematicians in which he pointed out what he called a ``relativity of set-theoretic notions''. This ``relativity'' has frequently been regarded as paradoxical; but today, although one hears the expression ``the L\"owenheim-Skolem Paradox'', it seems to be thought of as only an               apparent               paradox, something the cognoscenti enjoy but are not seriously troubled by. Thus van Heijenoort writes, ``The existence of such a `relativity' is sometimes referred to as the L\"owenheim-Skolem Paradox. But, of course, it is not a paradox in the sense of an antinomy; it is a novel and unexpected feature of formal systems.'' In this address I want to take up Skolem's arguments, not with the aim of refuting them but with the aim of extending them in somewhat the direction he seemed to be indicating. It is not my claim that the ``L\"owenheim-Skolem Paradox'' is an antinomy               in formal logic               ; but I shall argue that it               is               an antinomy, or something close to it, in               philosophy of language               . Moreover, I shall argue that the resolution of the antinomy---the only resolution that I myself can see as making sense---has profound implications for the great metaphysical dispute about realism which has always been the central dispute in the philosophy of language.                          The structure of my argument will be as follows: I shall point out that in many different areas there are three main positions on reference and truth: there is the extreme Platonist position, which posits nonnatural mental powers of directly ``grasping'' forms (it is characteristic of this position that ``understanding'' or ``grasping'' is itself an irreducible and unexplicated notion); there is the verificationist position which replaces the classical notion of truth with the notion of verification or proof, at least when it comes to describing how the language is understood; and there is the moderate realist position which seeks to preserve the centrality of the classical notions of truth and reference without postulating nonnatural mental powers.},

  abstract = {AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.},

A natural history of children\~Os developing self-awareness is proposed as well as a model of adult self-awareness that is informed by the dynamic of early development. Adult self-awareness is viewed as the dynamic flux between basic levels of consciousness that develop chronologically early in life.},

Newton created an abstract system of theorizing which has been applied to all aspects of the physical world, however he had difficulties in persuading his contemporaries of its unique merits. A detailed study of Newton's writings, published and unpublished, suggests that he had an almost archetypally powerful mode of thinking guaranteed to produce 'correct' results even in areas of physics where systematic study only began long after his time. Newton and Modern Physics investigates this phenomena, looking at examples of where Newton's principles have relevance to modern day thinking -- the study of Newton's work in both seventeenth century and present-day contexts helps to enhance our understanding of both. Published by World Scientific as the first of a three-part set for Newtonian scholars, historians of science, philosophers of science and others interested in Newtonian physics, the other titles are Newton and the Great World System and Newton and Controversy, by Peter Rowlands, (2017)"--},

  abstract = {"In the popular imagination, superhuman artificial intelligence is an approaching tidal wave that threatens not just jobs and human relationships, but civilization itself. Conflict between humans and machines is seen as inevitable and its outcome all too predictable. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished AI researcher Stuart Russell argues that this scenario can be avoided, but only if we rethink AI from the ground up. Russell begins by exploring the idea of intelligence in humans and in machines. He describes the near-term benefits we can expect, from intelligent personal assistants to vastly accelerated scientific research, and outlines the AI breakthroughs that still have to happen before we reach superhuman AI. He also spells out the ways humans are already finding to misuse AI, from lethal autonomous weapons to viral sabotage. If the predicted breakthroughs occur and superhuman AI emerges, we will have created entities far more powerful than ourselves. How can we ensure they never, ever, have power over us? Russell suggests that we can rebuild AI on a new foundation, according to which machines are designed to be inherently uncertain about the human preferences they are required to satisfy. Such machines would be humble, altruistic, and committed to pursue our objectives, not theirs. This new foundation would allow us to create machines that are provably deferential and provably beneficial. In a 2014 editorial co-authored with Stephen Hawking, Russell wrote, "Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last." Solving the problem of control over AI is not just possible; it is the key that unlocks a future of unlimited promise"--},

  abstract = {The role of the amygdala in unconscious emotional processing remains a topic of debate. Past lesion studies have indicated that amygdala damage leads to impaired electrodermal activity in response to subliminally presented emotional stimuli. However, electrodermal activity can reflect both emotional and nonemotional processes. To provide behavioral evidence highlighting the critical role of the amygdala in unconscious emotional processing, we examined patients (n\,=\,16) who had undergone unilateral resection of medial temporal lobe structures, including the amygdala. We utilized the subliminal affective priming paradigm in conjunction with unilateral visual presentation. Fearful or happy dynamic facial expressions were presented in unilateral visual fields for 30~ms, serving as negative or positive primes. Subsequently, neutral target faces were displayed, and participants were tasked with rating the valence of these targets. Positive primes, compared to negative ones, enhanced valence ratings of the target to a greater extent when they stimulated the intact hemisphere (i.e., were presented in the contralateral visual field of the intact hemisphere) than when they stimulated the resected hemisphere (i.e., were presented in the contralateral visual field of the resected hemisphere). These results suggest that the amygdala is causally involved in unconscious emotional processing.},

The essay traces the emergence of the historiographical concept ``exploratory experimentation'' in the late 1990s. The reconstruction of the early discussions about exploratory experimentation shows that the introduction of the concept had unintended consequences: Initially designed to debunk philosophical ideas about theory testing, the concept ``exploratory experimentation'' quickly exposed the poverty of our conceptual tools for the analysis of experimental practice. Looking back at a number of detailed analyses of experimental research, we can now appreciate that the concept of exploratory experimentation is too vague and too elusive to fill the desideratum whose existence it revealed.},

In three experiments using different methods we asked whether the number of distinct senses linked with the semantic features of objects would impact word recognition and learning. Specifically, in  we asked whether words linked with more multisensory experiences were learned earlier than words linked fewer multisensory experiences. In , we asked whether 2-year-olds' known words linked with more multisensory experiences were better recognized than those linked with fewer. Finally, in , we taught 2-year-olds labels for novel objects that were linked with either just visual or visual and tactile experiences and asked whether this impacted their ability to learn the new label-to-object mappings. Results converge to support an account in which richer multisensory experiences better support word learning. We discuss two pathways through which rich multisensory experiences might support word learning.},

  abstract = {Thanks to rapid progress in artificial intelligence, we have entered an era when technology and philosophy intersect in interesting ways. Sitting squarely at the centre of this intersection are large language models (LLMs). The more adept LLMs become at mimicking human language, the more vulnerable we become to anthropomorphism, to seeing the systems in which they are embedded as more human-like than they really are. This trend is amplified by the natural tendency to use philosophically loaded terms, such as "knows", "believes", and "thinks", when describing these systems. To mitigate this trend, this paper advocates the practice of repeatedly stepping back to remind ourselves of how LLMs, and the systems of which they form a part, actually work. The hope is that increased scientific precision will encourage more philosophical nuance in the discourse around artificial intelligence, both within the field and in the public sphere.},

The essay argues five theses: (1) Being is the meaningful presence of things to man. (2) Such meaningful presence is the Befragtes of Heidegger's question, not the Erfragtes. (3) Being and Time's goal was to articulate the openness that allows for all meaningfulness. (4) Ereignis -- the appropriation of exsistence to sustaining the clearing -- is the later Heidegger's reinscription of thrown-openness, der geworfene Entwurf.

  abstract = {In the present essay we attempt to reconstruct Newtonian mechanics under the guidance of logical principles and of a constructive approach related to the genetic epistemology of Piaget and Garc\'ia (Psychogenesis and the history of science, Columbia University Press, New York, 1989). Instead of addressing Newton's equations as a set of axioms, ultimately given by the revelation of a prodigious mind, we search for the fundamental knowledge, beliefs and provisional assumptions that can produce classical mechanics. We start by developing our main tool: the no arbitrariness principle, that we present in a form that is apt for a mathematical theory as classical mechanics. Subsequently, we introduce the presence of the observer, analysing then the relation objective--subjective and seeking objectivity going across subjectivity. We take special care of establishing the precedence among all contributions to mechanics, something that can be better appreciated by considering the consequences of removing them: (a) the consequence of renouncing logic and the laws of understanding is not being able to understand the world, (b) renouncing the early elaborations of primary concepts such as time and space leads to a dissociation between everyday life and physics, the latter becoming entirely pragmatic and justified a-posteriori (because it is convenient), (c) changing our temporary beliefs has no real cost other than effort. Finally, we exemplify the present approach by reconsidering the constancy of the velocity of light. It is shown that it is a result of Newtonian mechanics, rather than being in contradiction with it. We also indicate the hidden assumption that leads to the (apparent) contradiction.},

  abstract = {The nineteenth century was a formative period for electromagnetism and electrodynamics. Hans Christian \O rsted's groundbreaking discovery of the interaction between electricity and magnetism in 1820 inspired a wave of research, led to the science of electrodynamics, and resulted in the development of electromagnetic theory. Remarkably, in response, Andr\'e-Marie Amp\`ere and Michael Faraday developed two incompatible, competing theories. Although their approaches and conceptual frameworks were fundamentally different, together their work launched a technological revolution - laying the foundation for our modern scientific understanding of electricity - and one of the most important debates in physics, between electrodynamic action-at-a-distance and field theories. In this foundational study, now available in English, Friedrich Steinle compares the influential work of Amp\`ere and Faraday to reveal the prominent role of exploratory experimentation in the development of science. While this exploratory phase was responsible for decisive conceptual innovations, it has yet to be examined in such great detail. Focusing on Amp\`ere's and Faraday's research practices, reconstructed from previously unknown archival materials, including laboratory notes, diaries, letters, and interactions with instrument makers, this book considers both the historic and epistemological basis of exploratory experimentation and its importance to scientific development. -- from dust jacket},

The famous description ``something / that than which nothing greater can be conceived'' is part and parcel of his argument. Most commentators have interpreted this description as a definition of God. We argue that this view, which we refer to as ``definitionism'', is a misrepresentation. In addition to textual evidence, the key point of our argument is that taking the putative definition as what Anselm intended it to be -- namely a description of a content of faith -- allows getting a clear view of the discursive status and argumentative structure of Proslogion 2--4, as well as making sense of an often neglected part of the argument.},

Postscript: Living with Uncertainty -- Notes -- Index The provided context discusses various themes related to the interpretation and presentation of philosophical and scientific knowledge. Here's a summary based on the snippets given: Levels of Historical Understanding: The text describes different levels at which historical events are perceived. Initially, raw facts might seem unsatisfying without interpretation. Over longer periods, these facts can be grouped into significant events like the French Revolution, stripped of unnecessary details to gain explanatory power. There's also mention of a much longer-term perspective that may provide even broader explanations [1]. Perspectives in Academic Discourse: The text underscores the importance of perspective in storytelling within intellectual debates, particularly noting that different academic disciplines frame arguments according to their conventions. The emergence of alternative perspectives in the 1960s is highlighted, as these perspectives allowed for discussions beyond formal academic settings, challenging the need for arguments to fit within a specific disciplinary framework [2]. Language and Reason: The role of language in human reason is explored, tracing the term logos back to its roots, which involve gathering or selecting objects or themes for communication. This suggests that a primary purpose of language and reason is to create inventories, counting or categorizing elements worth discussing [3]. Complexity in Ethical Theory: The passage suggests that in the realm of ethical theory, dialogues often sway sympathies in multiple directions, leading to complexity and difficulty in summarization. This portrays the challenge of creating simple generalizations in philosophical discussions, highlighting the nuanced nature of philosophical dialogue [4]. Understanding Scientific Concepts: There is a critique of how scientific concepts are sometimes presented, particularly to lay audiences. Simplifying complex ideas into formulas---like   ccc},

It finds a departure in the analogous ways each discipline extends their core frameworks toward social and anthropological objects. However, this shared ground is not without tensions. In the post-war American context, what is formalizable and realizable in mechanical structures has a certain explanatory authority---even if often misplaced-- concerning perception and human intelligence. Cultural patterns feed into mechanical recognition of patterns, exemplifying ``extractive empiricism'' or the process of outsourcing experiential processes to mechanical systems. This mode of ``proof'' is also evident in cybernetic and cognitive psychological strategies toward Gestalt theory, leaving a significant legacy for contemporary machine learning approaches. By examining the early interactions between these rival paradigms, known for their quest for generalization, and disentangling their source status, this inquiry contributes to understanding the broad conceptual possibilities of pattern recognition beyond its narrow confines in engineering perspectives and machine learning discourse.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Cognitive penetration describes the influence of higher level cognitive factors on perceptual experience and has been a debated topic in philosophy of mind and cognitive science. Here, we focus on visual perception, particularly early vision, and how it is affected by contextual expectations and memorized cognitive contents. We argue for cognitive penetration based on recent empirical evidence demonstrating contextual and top-down influences on early visual processes. On the basis of a perceptual model, we propose different types of cognitive penetration depending on the processing level on which the penetration happens and depending on where the penetrating influence comes from. Our proposal has two consequences: (1) the traditional controversy on whether cognitive penetration occurs or not is ill posed, and (2) a clear-cut perception--cognition boundary cannot be maintained.},

They suggested that concepts refer solely to an organism's behavior and to the conditions under which it occurs; as such, conceptual behavior need be neither verbal nor uniquely human. Herrnstein and Loveland (1964) advanced that behavioral perspective by deploying an elegant training procedure to teach visual concepts to pigeons. Keller and Schoenfeld's perspective and Herrnstein and Loveland's methodology have inspired my own research into conceptualization by pigeons. Using a system of arbitrary visual tokens, my colleagues and I have built everexpanding nonverbal ``vocabularies'' in pigeons through a variety of different concept learning tasks. Pigeons have reliably categorized as many as 2,000 individual photographs from as many as 16 different human object categories, even without the benefit of seeing an item twice. Our formal model of conceptualization effectively embraces 25 years of empirical evidence as well as generates novel predictions for both pigeon and human conceptual behavior. Comparative study should continue to elucidate the commonalities and disparities between human and nonhuman conceptual behavior; it should also explicate the relationship between associative learning, object recognition, conceptualization, and language.},

It is in connection with the double-barrelled air-pump, that the accepted history of the instrument is chiefly erroneous, but the mistakes made in reference to the more complex engine, have ultimately involved in confusion even the authentic records of the steps by which the earlier single-barrelled air-pump was improved, so that the account of its successive alterations must commence with its earliest and simplest construction.},
